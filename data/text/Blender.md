This is a post on the Blender development forum discussing the transition of the Blender developer documentation from a wiki to a Markdown-based platform. The post highlights the benefits of the change, including easier contributions and improved organization, and asks for feedback from the community. The post also mentions that this change will only affect the developers' documentation for now, but the possibility of using the new platform for other documentations like Blender itself and bpy in the future.

Here are some key points from the post:

* The current state of the developer documentation is a wiki, which can be difficult to navigate and contribute to.
* The new platform will be based on Markdown, which is easier to read and write.
* This change will make it easier for developers to contribute to the documentation.
* The new platform will also provide better organization and search functionality.
* The transition will only affect the developer documentation for now, but there is a possibility of using the new platform for other documentations like Blender itself and bpy in the future.
* The post invites feedback from the community on the change.
