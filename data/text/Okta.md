This is a Python code for a chatbot that uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to answer questions about the Okta Developer Documentation. Here's a summary of the code:

1. The first few lines import the necessary libraries, including Panel, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI.
2. The next block of code installs the required packages and sets up the OpenAI API key.
3. The following code creates a client prompt for the user to enter their questions, and a button to initiate the conversation with the chatbot.
4. The add_prompts_conversation function is defined, which takes in the context of the conversation and appends new messages to it based on the user's input.
5. The main conversation loop iterates over each message in the context and uses the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the user's input.
6. The chatbot's responses are displayed on the web interface in real-time, and the conversation can be ended by saying "Thank you" or leaving the page.
7. Finally, there are some additional resources and information provided about the Python chatbot, including a cheat sheet for controlling the creativity/deterministic output of prompt responses.

This code is just an example, and there are many ways to improve and customize it based on your specific needs. If you have any questions or would like to know more about building your own chatbot with AI, please feel free to reach out!
