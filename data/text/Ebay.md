eBay has introduced a new feature that uses artificial intelligence to generate social media posts for sellers. The feature, called "AI-Generated Social Media Posts," is available in the US, UK, Germany, and Australia. Sellers can access it by visiting the Social page in Seller Hub and clicking the "Use AI Caption" button next to the text entry box when adding a social media caption. The AI-generated post will include hashtags and emojis, and sellers can customize it by manually editing the text. The feature is designed to help sellers save time and increase their exposure on social media platforms.
