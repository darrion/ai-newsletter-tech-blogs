The provided text is a technical blog post discussing how Grab, a leading superapp platform in Southeast Asia, uses AWS and Kubernetes to build a highly available and fault-tolerant Kafka cluster. The post highlights the challenges faced by the Grab tech team in implementing this solution and how they overcame them.

Here is a breakdown of the text:

1. Introduction: The blog post introduces the topic of building a highly available and fault-tolerant Kafka cluster using AWS and Kubernetes.
2. Background: The post provides some background information on Grab's need for a highly available Kafka cluster and how Kafka is used in the company's service.
3. Challenges: The team faced several challenges when implementing this solution, including dealing with instance termination delays, handling EBS volume stuck in optimizing state during modification, and ensuring cost-effectiveness.
4. Solution: To overcome these challenges, the team developed a novel approach that involves using Kubernetes to manage the Kafka cluster, creating an Amazon SQS queue to receive termination events, and leveraging AWS SQS to send notifications to Grab's engineers.
5. Future plans: The post mentions that the team is exploring ways to improve the NTH's capability by utilizing webhooks and autoscaling EBS gp3 volumes for better performance and cost-Effectiveness.

The text is written in a technical style and assumes some knowledge of Kafka, AWS, and Kubernetes. It is intended for an audience interested in learning about how Grab uses technology to build highly available and fault-tolerant systems.
