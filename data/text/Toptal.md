The article discusses the importance of having a well-defined corporate strategy for small and medium businesses (SMBs) to achieve their objectives and increase value or profits. The author explains that corporate strategy is the roadmap a company uses to reach its goals, and it includes four levels or elements: visioning, setting objectives, allocating resources, and prioritizing or determining trade-offs.

The author highlights that SMBs often overlook these elements and focus solely on tactical actions, which can lead to a lack of direction and poor decision-making. To overcome this challenge, the author suggests taking the time on the front end to seek out the root cause of problems and testing your hypothesis as much as you can before implementing a new improvement.

The article also discusses five elements of corporate strategy, which include:

1. Arenas (markets, categories, and needs)
2. Vehicles (methods)
3. Differentiators (unique features)
4. Staging (processes and timeline)
5. Economic logic (business model)

The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these elements and rigorously challenging each assumption to filter out what doesn't work before implementing a new improvement. By taking the time on the front end to seek out the root cause of problems and testing your hypothesis as much as you can, SMBs can arrive at their solution and refine their corporate strategy more efficiently and effectively.

The article concludes by emphasizing that even when there isn't a problem that needs to be corrected, SMBs can use this approach to evaluate any new strategy option, such as a price change, a new product launch or feature, the targeting of a new customer group, or an entirely new business idea. By taking the time on the front end to seek out the root cause of problems and testing your hypothesis as much as you can, SMBs can arrive at their solution and refine their corporate strategy more efficiently and effectively.
