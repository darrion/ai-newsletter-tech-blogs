The post from the Yahoo Engineering blog discusses new features and updates in Bullet, an open-source lightweight, scalable, pluggable, multi-tenant query system. The highlights include:

1. Windowing: Bullet now supports time and record-based windowing, with overlapping windows and hopping windows currently being worked on.
2. Apache Pulsar support: Bullet now supports Apache Pulsar as a native PubSub, making it easier to use Pulsar as the underlying messaging service.
3. Plug your data into Bullet without code: Bullet DSL (Text/Configuration-based format) allows users to plug in their data without writing any code.
4. Connector and Converter components: Bullet DSL abstracts away the two major components for plugging data into the Bullet Backend, making it easier to use different data sources and convert data into the Bullet record container.
5. Open source and community contribution: Bullet is open source, and the community is encouraged to contribute and help maintain the project.
6. Quickstarts on Spark and Storm: The post includes links to quickstart guides for setting up an instance of Bullet on Spark and Storm.
