The text is a blog post about using DDSketch and TDigest for efficient and reliable percentile calculations. The author describes the problem of running resource-intensive and time-intensive calculations asynchronously, and how they built a system called global_benchmarking to solve this problem. The system uses DDSketch and TDigest to perform percentile calculations on large datasets, and it has improved the efficiency and reliability of the benchmarking process. The author also provides some background information on DDSketch and TDigest, and explains how they were used in the system.

Here are some key points from the text:

* DDSketch and TDigest are efficient and reliable algorithms for performing percentile calculations.
* global_benchmarking is a system that uses these algorithms to perform asynchronous percentile calculations on large datasets.
* The system was built to improve the efficiency and reliability of benchmarking processes for recruiters and hiring managers.
* DDSketch is a probabilistic data structure that can be used to estimate the percentile of a dataset.
* TDigest is another probabilistic data structure that can be used to estimate the percentile of a dataset.
* Both DDSketch and TDigest are based on the idea of sketching, which involves randomly sampling from the dataset to estimate its properties.
* The authors used these algorithms in their system to perform efficient and reliable percentile calculations on large datasets.

Overall, the text is describing a solution for efficient and reliable percentile calculations using DDSketch and TDigest, and how it can be useful for benchmarking processes in recruitment and hiring.
