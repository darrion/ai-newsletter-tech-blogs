Flickr has added a code of conduct to their open source repositories on GitHub to celebrate Safer Internet Day and make their spaces safer and more accessible for all contributors, especially the youngest and most underrepresented. The code of conduct is based on the Contributor Covenant, which is a widely adopted code of conduct for open source communities that outlines expectations for creating a healthy and safe community. The code of conduct emphasizes the importance of kindness, empathy, and respect for all contributors, and provides specific guidelines for interpersonal interactions and conflict resolution. By adopting this code of conduct, Flickr is committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors to collaborate and innovate.
