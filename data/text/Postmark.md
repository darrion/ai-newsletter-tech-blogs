This is an email sent by ActiveCampaign, a marketing automation platform, to its users. The email informs them of upcoming changes to email delivery requirements from Gmail and Yahoo, which will impact senders who use the company's service for bulk or marketing emails. The changes include new requirements for authentication, enhanced deliverability, and engagement.

The email highlights that Postmark, ActiveCampaign's email delivery service, already meets some of these requirements automatically, such as including a list-unsubscribe header in broadcast emails and handling FCrDNS. It also mentions that transactional senders should comply with enhanced deliverability and engagement requirements, and that the company will continue to provide updates on any changes to these requirements.

The email ends with an invitation to learn more about ActiveCampaign's email delivery service and how it can help senders meet the new requirements.
