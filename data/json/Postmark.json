If you want to make sure your emails keep making it to the inbox, follow these 5 steps.\n\nJump ahead\n\n\nWhy Google and Yahoo are changing the rules for bulk email senders\n\n\nWhy the changes matter for every email sender\n\n\nChecklist: 5 steps to ensure compliance\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\nSince the announcement in October, 2023, the email industry has been buzzing about these collaborative announcements from Google and Yahoo. These two receivers have agreed it's time to start enforcing new rules\u00a0to help protect recipients from unwanted emails.\nWhy Google and Yahoo are changing the rules for email senders #\nProperly authenticating your emails has always been a best practice, but not all senders are using the tools available to protect their emails. And that\u2019s a major problem: If senders don\u2019t properly authenticate their emails, they\u2019re making it incredibly easy for bad actors to impersonate domains and to send phishing\u2014and that will damage your sending reputation. \nGmail and Yahoo are on a mission to protect their users from spam and unwanted emails, but if senders fail to properly secure their systems and leave the door for exploitation wide open, that job is a whole lot harder. That\u2019s why Gmail and Yahoo decided that proper email authentication and following deliverability best practices are no longer a nice-to-have. If you want to ensure your emails continue to make it to the inbox, you\u2019ll have to comply with key best practices for email authentication and spam prevention. According to the inbox providers, that means:  \nAuthenticating your emails using DKIM, SPF, and DMARC.We'll\u00a0show you how to do that.\u00a0Reducing spam and maintaining a spam complaint rate under 0.3%.Here's how you can keep an eye on that.Allowing people to unsubscribe by clicking just one link, and honor unsubscribes within two days.Postmark handles unsubscribes for Broadcast messages for you so you don't have to worry about that.RFC 5322 compliance, PTR records, rDNSPostmark has you covered here.Making sure your sending server IP addresses have\u00a0valid reverse DNS records.Postmark has you covered here.Use a TLS connection for transmitting email.Out of the box, Postmark supports opportunistic TLS for all outbound email, ensuring messages are encrypted in transit.\nOur take: These changes matter for every email sender #\nGmail and Yahoo\u2019s new requirements primarily target large bulk senders, and if you\u2019re diving into their requirements in detail, you\u2019ll see that some of them will only apply to high-volume senders who send more than 5,000 emails a day. If you\u2019re a smaller sender or only send transactional email, you\u2019re less likely to be impacted by the changes\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean you can ignore them. \nWhat\u2019s required for large senders today will likely become a requirement for all senders in the future. Plus, operating in the \u201cbarely compliant\u201d zone, hoping the authorities don\u2019t look at you too closely because you\u2019re a small fish is rarely a good strategy. We believe this isn\u2019t just true when you do your taxes, but for sending email, too. \nSo whether you send one email or a few million, protecting your domains, avoiding spam, and following deliverability best practices is the key to keeping your subscribers safe and your email program healthy. Get ready for the Gmail and Yahoo changes in 5 steps #\nIf you\u2019re a Postmark customer, here are the top 5 steps we recommend you take now to make sure your emails keep making it to Google and Yahoo inboxes in 2024: 1. Understand what domains you use for email sending today (and whether they\u2019re already authenticated) #\nBefore you can start sending email with Postmark, we ensure you own the mailboxes you want to send from. You can either validate a single email address (i.e. we just send you a confirmation link via email that you need to click on), or you can validate an entire domain by making some tweaks to your DNS records. \nThe first option is simpler, but as Gmail and Yahoo tighten their requirements, we encourage you to fully authenticate your sending domains. \nHead over to the Sender Signatures tab in your Postmark account to see what email addresses and domains are set up in your Postmark account\u2014and to see the status of each domain. \nIf you\u2019ve only verified individual email addresses, you\u2019ll see that you still need to take action to properly authenticate your domain: \n\n\n\n\nSeeing bright red in your Sender Signatures overview means open authentication tasks for you! \ud83d\udd34\n\nClick on the DNS settings for a more detailed overview of your domain\u2019s status. If you see a row of green check marks here, your domain is properly authenticated (and you can jump ahead to task #4). If your domain details look like this though, you\u2019ll want to take action to properly authenticate your sending domain:   \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Authenticate your mail with custom DKIM #\nDKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an email authentication method that confirms your legitimacy and trustworthiness as a sender and verifies that the messages were not altered in transit. Going forward, Yahoo! and Gmail will require all email to be DKIM signed, so if you haven\u2019t already, now is the time to implement your custom DKIM signature.\nThis custom DKIM setup will require you (or whoever manages your domain) to add a TXT record to your domain\u2019s DNS. We show you what values you should include when you visit your domain\u2019s DNS setting in Postmark: \n\n\n\n\n\nFor step-by-step instructions on how to validate your domain using DKIM, check out our support article here.\n3. Authenticate your mail with custom SPF #\nThe Return-Path (also known as the \"envelope-from\") is the address where bounces and other email feedback are sent, and it's also the domain used for SPF authentication. It is specified by the Return-Path header in an email, and by default, the Return-Path for emails sent through Postmark is:\nReturn-Path: <pm_bounces@pm.mtasv.net>\nReplacing Postmark\u2019s default Return-Path domain with your own sending domain means your messages are now SPF authenticated with your sending domain. This helps build your domain's reputation while also providing SPF domain alignment for your domain's DMARC policy.\nYou can set up a custom Return-Path by adding a CNAME record to your DNS that points to pm.mtasv.net. This is so that Postmark is still able to collect bounces and other feedback sent to that address.\n4. Set up DMARC #\nDMARC is an email security standard that allows domain owners to monitor who\u2019s sending email using their domain and instructs email receivers (like Gmail) to approve, quarantine, or reject emails that aren\u2019t sent from an authenticated source. \nGmail and Yahoo will start requiring DMARC for all bulk senders who send more than 5,000 messages a day, but even if you aren\u2019t sending at that volume, we encourage you to set up DMARC anyway. Here\u2019s a step-by-step walkthrough of how you can set up DMARC for your domain. Gmail and Yahoo don't require\u00a0strict DMARC policies, so you can get started with a \u201cp=none\u201d policy. With that policy in place, you can start monitoring who\u2019s sending email using your domain without receivers taking any action just yet.  \n\n\n\nDMARC monitoring for humans\nIf you\u2019re looking for a simple DMARC monitoring tool, try Postmark\u2019s DMARC Digests\n\n\nGet started\n\n\n\n\nIf you visit your domain details in Postmark at this point, you should be able to see what we call the magic trifecta of email authentication \ud83d\udd10\ud83d\udd10\ud83d\udd10.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Register your domain for Google Postmaster Tools and keep your spam complaint rates under 0.3% #\nGmail will require senders to keep the spam complaint rate below 0.3%. If a larger share of your recipients mark your emails as spam, your sender reputation will decrease\u2014and you\u2019ll have a harder time reaching the inbox. \nIf you\u2019re a Postmark customer, you can see spam reports from most inbox providers in your Postmark account, but Gmail is a bit of a special case. Since Gmail doesn\u2019t provide a feedback loop\u2014that\u2019s the process for sharing spam report data with email providers\u2014you can\u2019t see spam reports from Gmail users in your Postmark account.\nTo keep an eye on your spam report data from Gmail users, you\u2019ll have to register your domain with a dedicated service, Google\u2019s Postmaster Tools. Registering your domain is free, only takes a minute, and once you\u2019re set up and Google has collected some email data, you can see aggregated spam report information in your Postmaster account.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see your user-reported spam rate grow beyond 0.1%, that shows that there\u2019s room for improvement. If you see your spam rate approach 0.3%, that\u2019s a sign you should urgently take action.  \nFollow these best practices to reduce your spam rate\nIf you have any additional questions about these changes, check out our FAQ below\u2014and if you don\u2019t find the answer to your question there, please reach out! We\u2019re here to help. \nFAQs #\nQ. What happens if I send mail that doesn't meet these requirements? #\nA. \u201cIf senders don\u2019t meet these requirements, messages might be rejected or delivered to recipients\u2019 spam folders,\u201d say the folks at Gmail. \nQ. When will these changes take place? #\nA. Changes are set to roll out gradually from February 2024, allowing for optimization and adjustments based on industry feedback.\nQ. Yahoo and Gmail mention additional requirements in their documents that you don\u2019t mention in the blog post above. Why do you not include them in your tips for senders? #\nA. If you\u2019re sending email with Postmark, we automatically take care of some of the crucial requirements that the inbox providers will be enforcing. For example, we automatically include a list-unsubscribe header to all Broadcast emails you might send with Postmark and handle FCrDNS (Forward-Confirmed Reverse DNS) for all our sending IPs. \nQ. How will this affect transactional senders? #\nA. While the changes primarily target bulk mail, transactional senders\u2014and especially those that are sending over 5000 messages a day\u2014should comply with requirements for enhanced deliverability and engagement. Distinguishing transactional and bulk mail is crucial, and Postmark makes that easy through Message Streams.\nQ. \u200b\u200bWhat is the bulk threshold for anti-spam policy? #\nA. Google will be requiring specific rules for users who send over 5,000 messages a day. However, users who send less than 5,000 messages will still need to authenticate their messages with SPF and DKIM. \nYahoo doesn't yet specify any particular volume for these categories of senders, nor do they specify a spam complaint rate threshold.\nQ. Could these requirements and our understanding of them change? #\nA.

You can either validate a single email address (i.e. we just send you a confirmation link via email that you need to click on), or you can validate an entire domain by making some tweaks to your DNS records. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first option is simpler, but as Gmail and Yahoo tighten their requirements, we encourage you to fully authenticate your sending domains. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Head over to the <a href=\"https://account.postmarkapp.com/signature_domains\">Sender Signatures</a> tab in your Postmark account to see what email addresses and domains are set up in your Postmark account\u2014and to see the status of each domain. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019ve only verified individual email addresses, you\u2019ll see that you still need to take action to properly authenticate your domain: </p></div>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                                                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n\n          \n          <figure>\n            <img alt=\"\" height=\"205\" src=\"https://craft-assets.postmarkapp.com/blog/outstanding-postmark-domain-authentication-tasks.png\" title=\"\" width=\"999\" />\n\n                          <figcaption>Seeing bright red in your Sender Signatures overview means open authentication tasks for you! \ud83d\udd34</figcaption>\n            \n          </figure>\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        <p dir=\"ltr\">Click on the DNS settings for a more detailed overview of your domain\u2019s status.

Authenticate your mail with custom SPF</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Return-Path (also known as the \"envelope-from\") is the address where bounces and other email feedback are sent, and it's also the domain used for SPF authentication. It is specified by the Return-Path header in an email, and by default, the Return-Path for emails sent through Postmark is:</p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        <pre><code class=\"language-markup\">Return-Path: &lt;pm_bounces@pm.mtasv.net&gt;</code></pre>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        <p dir=\"ltr\">Replacing Postmark\u2019s default Return-Path domain with your own sending domain means your messages are now SPF authenticated with your sending domain. This helps build your domain's reputation while also providing SPF domain alignment for your domain's DMARC policy.</p>\n\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/910-how-do-i-add-a-custom-return-path\">set up a custom Return-Path</a> by adding a CNAME record to your DNS that points to pm.mtasv.net. This is so that Postmark is still able to collect bounces and other feedback sent to that address.<br /></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Set up DMARC</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br /><a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/guides/dmarc\">DMARC</a> is an email security standard that allows domain owners to monitor who\u2019s sending email using their domain and instructs email receivers (like Gmail) to approve, quarantine, or reject emails that aren\u2019t sent from an authenticated source. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gmail and Yahoo will start requiring DMARC</strong> for all bulk senders who send more than 5,000 messages a day, but even if you aren\u2019t sending at that volume, we encourage you to set up DMARC anyway. Here\u2019s a step-by-step walkthrough of <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/guides/dmarc#how-do-i-setup-and-implement-dmarc-on-my-domain\">how you can set up DMARC for your domain</a>. Gmail and Yahoo don't require&nbsp;strict DMARC policies, so you can get started with a <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/guides/dmarc#how-do-i-setup-and-implement-dmarc-on-my-domain\">\u201cp=none\u201d policy</a>. With that policy in place, you can start monitoring who\u2019s sending email using your domain without receivers taking any action just yet.  <br /></p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n    \n      \n        <p><br /></p>\n<p>If you visit your domain details in Postmark at this point, you should be able to see what we call the magic trifecta of email authentication &#x1f510;&#x1f510;&#x1f510;.</p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                                                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n\n          \n          <figure>\n            <img alt=\"\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://craft-assets.postmarkapp.com/blog/successfully-authenticated.png\" title=\"\" width=\"479\" />\n\n            \n          </figure>\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        <h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Register your domain for Google Postmaster Tools and keep your spam complaint rates under 0.3%</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gmail will require senders to keep the spam complaint rate below 0.3%</strong>. If a larger share of your recipients mark your emails as spam, your sender reputation will decrease\u2014and you\u2019ll have a harder time reaching the inbox. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re a Postmark customer, you can see spam reports from most inbox providers in your Postmark account, but Gmail is a bit of a special case. Since Gmail doesn\u2019t provide a feedback loop\u2014that\u2019s the process for sharing spam report data with email providers\u2014you can\u2019t see spam reports from Gmail users in your Postmark account.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To keep an eye on your spam report data from Gmail users, you\u2019ll have to register your domain with a dedicated service, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9981691?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6259779&amp;sjid=11226422159337736043-EU\">Google\u2019s Postmaster Tools</a>. Registering your domain is free, only takes a minute, and once you\u2019re set up and Google has collected some email data, you can see aggregated spam report information in your Postmaster account.</p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                                                \n                    \n            \n                                            \n                                            \n            \n                        \n          \n\n          \n          <figure>\n            <img alt=\"\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://craft-assets.postmarkapp.com/blog/_normal2x/spam-rate-google-postmaster.png\" title=\"\" width=\"610\" />\n\n            \n          </figure>\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        <p dir=\"ltr\">If you see your user-reported spam rate grow beyond 0.1%, that shows that there\u2019s room for improvement.

When will these changes take place?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. Changes are set to roll out gradually from February 2024, allowing for optimization and adjustments based on industry feedback.</p>\n<h3><strong>Q. Yahoo and Gmail mention additional requirements in their documents that you don\u2019t mention in the blog post above. Why do you not include them in your tips for senders?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. If you\u2019re sending email with Postmark, we automatically take care of some of the crucial requirements that the inbox providers will be enforcing. For example, we automatically include a list-unsubscribe header to all Broadcast emails you might send with Postmark and handle FCrDNS (Forward-Confirmed Reverse DNS) for all our sending IPs. </p>\n<h3><strong>Q. How will this affect </strong><a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/transactional-email\"><strong>transactional</strong></a><strong> senders?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. While the changes primarily target bulk mail, transactional senders\u2014and especially those that are sending over 5000 messages a day\u2014should comply with requirements for enhanced deliverability and engagement. Distinguishing transactional and bulk mail is crucial, and Postmark makes that easy through <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/message-streams\">Message Streams</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Q. \u200b\u200bWhat is the bulk threshold for anti-spam policy?</strong><br /></h3>\n<p>A. Google will be requiring <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126?hl=en#requirements-5k&amp;zippy=%2Crequirements-for-all-senders%2Crequirements-for-sending-or-more-messages-per-day\">specific rules for users who send over 5,000 messages a day</a>. However, users who send less than 5,000 messages will still need to authenticate their messages with SPF and DKIM. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yahoo doesn't yet specify any particular volume for these categories of senders, nor do they specify a spam complaint rate threshold.</p>\n<h3><strong>Q. Could these requirements and our understanding of them change?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. Absolutely - in fact, let's expect them to!</p>\n<p><br /></p>"

These two receivers have agreed it's time to start enforcing new rules&nbsp;to help protect recipients from unwanted emails.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why Google and Yahoo are changing the rules for email senders</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Properly authenticating your emails has always been a best practice, but not all senders are using the tools available to protect their emails. And that\u2019s a major problem: If senders don\u2019t properly authenticate their emails, they\u2019re making it incredibly easy for bad actors to impersonate domains and to send phishing\u2014and that will damage your sending reputation. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gmail and Yahoo are on a mission to protect their users from spam and unwanted emails, but if senders fail to properly secure their systems and leave the door for exploitation wide open, that job is a whole lot harder. That\u2019s why Gmail and Yahoo decided that proper email authentication and following deliverability best practices are no longer a nice-to-have. If you want to ensure your emails continue to make it to the inbox, you\u2019ll have to comply with key best practices for email authentication and spam prevention. According to the inbox providers, that means:  <br /></p>\n<ol><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Authenticating your emails using DKIM, SPF, and DMARC.</strong><em><a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/#get-ready-for-the-gmail-and-yahoo-changes-in-5-steps\"><br />We'll&nbsp;show you how to do that.</a></em>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reducing spam and maintaining a spam complaint rate under 0.3%.</strong><em><a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/blog/2024-gmail-yahoo-email-requirements#5-register-your-domain-for-google-postmaster-tools-and-keep-your-spam-complaint-rates-under-0-3\"><br />Here's how you can keep an eye on that.</a></em></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Allowing people to unsubscribe by clicking just one link</strong>, and honor unsubscribes within two days.<em><br />Postmark handles <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1217-why-broadcasts-require-an-unsubscribe-link\">unsubscribes for Broadcast messages</a> for you so you don't have to worry about that.</em><strong><br /></strong></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>RFC 5322 compliance, PTR records, rDNS</strong><br /><em>Postmark has you covered here.</em></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Making sure your sending server IP addresses have&nbsp;valid reverse DNS records.</strong><em><br />Postmark has you covered here.</em></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Use a TLS connection for transmitting email.</strong><em></em><br /><em></em><em>Out of the box, Postmark supports <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/blog/gmail-improves-security-for-their-users\" target=\"_blank\">opportunistic TLS</a> for all outbound email, ensuring messages are encrypted in transit.</em></p></li></ol>\n<div><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Our take: These changes matter for every email sender</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gmail and Yahoo\u2019s new requirements primarily target large <em>bulk</em> senders, and if you\u2019re diving into their requirements in detail, you\u2019ll see that some of them will only apply to high-volume senders who send more than 5,000 emails a day. If you\u2019re a smaller sender or only send <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/transactional-email\">transactional email</a>, you\u2019re less likely to be impacted by the changes\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean you can <em>ignore</em> them. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What\u2019s required for large senders today will likely become a requirement for all senders in the future. Plus, operating in the \u201cbarely compliant\u201d zone, hoping the authorities don\u2019t look at you too closely because you\u2019re a small fish is rarely a good strategy. We believe this isn\u2019t just true when you do your taxes, but for sending email, too. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So whether you send one email or a few million, protecting your domains, avoiding spam, and following deliverability best practices is the key to keeping your subscribers safe and your email program healthy. </p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Get ready for the Gmail and Yahoo changes in 5 steps</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re a Postmark customer, here are the top 5 steps we recommend you take now to make sure your emails keep making it to Google and Yahoo inboxes in 2024: </p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">1.

It is specified by the Return-Path header in an email, and by default, the Return-Path for emails sent through Postmark is:</p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        <pre><code class=\"language-markup\">Return-Path: &lt;pm_bounces@pm.mtasv.net&gt;</code></pre>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        <p dir=\"ltr\">Replacing Postmark\u2019s default Return-Path domain with your own sending domain means your messages are now SPF authenticated with your sending domain. This helps build your domain's reputation while also providing SPF domain alignment for your domain's DMARC policy.</p>\n\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/910-how-do-i-add-a-custom-return-path\">set up a custom Return-Path</a> by adding a CNAME record to your DNS that points to pm.mtasv.net. This is so that Postmark is still able to collect bounces and other feedback sent to that address.<br /></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Set up DMARC</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br /><a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/guides/dmarc\">DMARC</a> is an email security standard that allows domain owners to monitor who\u2019s sending email using their domain and instructs email receivers (like Gmail) to approve, quarantine, or reject emails that aren\u2019t sent from an authenticated source. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gmail and Yahoo will start requiring DMARC</strong> for all bulk senders who send more than 5,000 messages a day, but even if you aren\u2019t sending at that volume, we encourage you to set up DMARC anyway. Here\u2019s a step-by-step walkthrough of <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/guides/dmarc#how-do-i-setup-and-implement-dmarc-on-my-domain\">how you can set up DMARC for your domain</a>. Gmail and Yahoo don't require&nbsp;strict DMARC policies, so you can get started with a <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/guides/dmarc#how-do-i-setup-and-implement-dmarc-on-my-domain\">\u201cp=none\u201d policy</a>. With that policy in place, you can start monitoring who\u2019s sending email using your domain without receivers taking any action just yet.  <br /></p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n    \n      \n        <p><br /></p>\n<p>If you visit your domain details in Postmark at this point, you should be able to see what we call the magic trifecta of email authentication &#x1f510;&#x1f510;&#x1f510;.</p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                                                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n\n          \n          <figure>\n            <img alt=\"\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://craft-assets.postmarkapp.com/blog/successfully-authenticated.png\" title=\"\" width=\"479\" />\n\n            \n          </figure>\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        <h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Register your domain for Google Postmaster Tools and keep your spam complaint rates under 0.3%</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gmail will require senders to keep the spam complaint rate below 0.3%</strong>. If a larger share of your recipients mark your emails as spam, your sender reputation will decrease\u2014and you\u2019ll have a harder time reaching the inbox. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re a Postmark customer, you can see spam reports from most inbox providers in your Postmark account, but Gmail is a bit of a special case. Since Gmail doesn\u2019t provide a feedback loop\u2014that\u2019s the process for sharing spam report data with email providers\u2014you can\u2019t see spam reports from Gmail users in your Postmark account.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To keep an eye on your spam report data from Gmail users, you\u2019ll have to register your domain with a dedicated service, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9981691?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6259779&amp;sjid=11226422159337736043-EU\">Google\u2019s Postmaster Tools</a>. Registering your domain is free, only takes a minute, and once you\u2019re set up and Google has collected some email data, you can see aggregated spam report information in your Postmaster account.</p>\n\n      \n    \n      \n        \n                                                \n                    \n            \n                                            \n                                            \n            \n                        \n          \n\n          \n          <figure>\n            <img alt=\"\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://craft-assets.postmarkapp.com/blog/_normal2x/spam-rate-google-postmaster.png\" title=\"\" width=\"610\" />\n\n            \n          </figure>\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        <p dir=\"ltr\">If you see your user-reported spam rate grow beyond 0.1%, that shows that there\u2019s room for improvement. If you see your spam rate approach 0.3%, that\u2019s a sign you should urgently take action.  </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Follow these <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/blog/why-are-my-emails-going-to-spam\">best practices to reduce your spam rate</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have any additional questions about these changes, check out our FAQ below\u2014and if you don\u2019t find the answer to your question there, please reach out! We\u2019re here to help. <br /></p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<h3>Q. What happens if I send mail that doesn't meet these requirements?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. \u201cIf senders don\u2019t meet these requirements, messages might be rejected or delivered to recipients\u2019 spam folders,\u201d <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/14229414#zippy=%2Cwhat-happens-if-senders-dont-meet-the-requirements-in-the-sender-guidelines\">say</a> the folks at Gmail. <br /></p>\n<h3><strong>Q. When will these changes take place?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. Changes are set to roll out gradually from February 2024, allowing for optimization and adjustments based on industry feedback.</p>\n<h3><strong>Q. Yahoo and Gmail mention additional requirements in their documents that you don\u2019t mention in the blog post above. Why do you not include them in your tips for senders?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. If you\u2019re sending email with Postmark, we automatically take care of some of the crucial requirements that the inbox providers will be enforcing. For example, we automatically include a list-unsubscribe header to all Broadcast emails you might send with Postmark and handle FCrDNS (Forward-Confirmed Reverse DNS) for all our sending IPs. </p>\n<h3><strong>Q. How will this affect </strong><a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/transactional-email\"><strong>transactional</strong></a><strong> senders?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. While the changes primarily target bulk mail, transactional senders\u2014and especially those that are sending over 5000 messages a day\u2014should comply with requirements for enhanced deliverability and engagement. Distinguishing transactional and bulk mail is crucial, and Postmark makes that easy through <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/message-streams\">Message Streams</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Q. \u200b\u200bWhat is the bulk threshold for anti-spam policy?</strong><br /></h3>\n<p>A. Google will be requiring <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126?hl=en#requirements-5k&amp;zippy=%2Crequirements-for-all-senders%2Crequirements-for-sending-or-more-messages-per-day\">specific rules for users who send over 5,000 messages a day</a>. However, users who send less than 5,000 messages will still need to authenticate their messages with SPF and DKIM. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yahoo doesn't yet specify any particular volume for these categories of senders, nor do they specify a spam complaint rate threshold.</p>\n<h3><strong>Q. Could these requirements and our understanding of them change?</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A. Absolutely - in fact, let's expect them to!</p>\n<p><br /></p>"
