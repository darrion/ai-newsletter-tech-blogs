     \n\n            Blog\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy \n\nMike Mason\n\n\n\n\n                    Published: January 16, 2024\u00a0\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the tech giants jostle in the AI investment space \u2014 and AI stocks skyrocket \u2014 there\u2019s one AI development in particular that\u2019s fast-expanding what AI can do for businesses: the AI agent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI like to think of it as \u2018any intelligent AI process that can act on behalf of a human to achieve a goal\u2019. The many possibilities that such agents are now opening up have earned them a \u2018beginning to see\u2019 place in our Looking Glass \u2018AI Trends to Watch\u2019 matrix, where we\u2019re strategically recommending their adoption.\n\u00a0\nAI agents can be autonomous to varying degrees. For example, you can give an agent a specific goal and then see how well it\u2019s achieved it \u2014 like when you ask ChatGPT to find certain information for you, \u2018web browser\u2019 style, or use its Python capabilities to interpret data.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOr you can ask an AI agent to come up with a multi-step plan to achieve a more complex goal \u2014 which it can systematically work through with your approval. Or you can go further, beyond traditional robotic process automation (RPA) thinking, to support ongoing business processes by using corporate AI agents that are now far more adaptable and intelligent.\n\u00a0\nThoughtworks\u2019 project modernizing fragmented systems for a multi-play Canadian telecoms company highlights the potential of this last route. Rather than a human manually deprovisioning a service and re-commissioning it to address a customer\u2019s problem, a fully autonomous AI agent could instead identify the issue and then solve it in the background. A semi-autonomous approach might involve a customer service rep identifying a problem and then instructing the AI agent to implement a suggested solution.\n\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s perhaps an AI agent\u2019s ability to interface with corporate systems and real-world data via APIs that, for me, is one of the most interesting current developments. OpenAI\u2019s GPT models, paired with Zapier to connect to 6,000+ corporate systems including Trello and Jira, is one example, and there are others such as Amazon\u2019s Bedrock platform and Google\u2019s Duet AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                However, as the potential for AI integration via agents increases in sophistication and the implications for getting things damagingly wrong multiply, so the need for effective risk management grows too. \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, while AWS Bedrock allows you to review an agent action plan and its \u2018thought\u2019 processes, enabling you to check they are what you\u2019d expect them to be, reliably testing AI agents in general remains an industry challenge. In the end, how much time and effort you commit to this will be influenced by the level of risk involved. While leaving a personalized marketing email process to run automatically may not have serious implications \u2014 especially when 95%+ of those emails sent will remain unread \u2014 the testing burden becomes much higher should the AI agent be interfacing with, say, an accounts receivable API.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTo help with this we\u2019re seeing significant investment increases from the big AI players to improve reliability, safety and testing. All this is underpinned by greater accountability and transparency as the capabilities of AI agents look set to increase. Alongside an ever-sharper focus on reliability, risk and capability, companies will also be looking to bear down on costs as they scale the use of agents, which can demand significant compute resources behind the scenes.\n\u00a0\nAI agents mark a step change in how companies can harness the power of AI interacting in richer ways with its environment to achieve their business goals faster, more cheaply and more effectively. And while fully recognizing the concerns of some around AI agents\u2019 autonomy, at Thoughtworks we believe that maintaining a laser-like focus on their management, direction and output is the best way for companies to reap the benefits of their huge potential.\n\u00a0\nIf you're interested in AI agent or other emerging trends in the field of AI, why not check our Thoughtworks\u2019 latest\u00a0Looking Glass\u00a0report?
