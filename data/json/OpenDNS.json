Vendors are processing increasing amounts of customer data and attracting unwanted attention from bad actors that steal consumers\u2019 personally identifiable information (PII).\nAdditional challenges include social engineering (phishing), ransomware, automation and bots, fake accounts, and web scraping. These all can have major consequences for organizations and their customers. To keep customer information and business data safeguarded, retailers must implement tough protection to keep up with the ever-changing threat landscape. Cisco Umbrella has a proven track record of winning in security for retailers.\nRoom & Board Home Furnishings retailer uses Umbrella\nRoom & Board Home Furnishings faced a huge challenge in building an integrated security stack that was strong enough to protect company data and enable business innovation. The Minneapolis-based retailer wanted customers to be able to experience the showroom from the comfort of their own homes. Room & Board envisioned that with augmented reality (AR), customers could share their living space and then the company would be able to suggest furnishings.\n\n\n\n\nCisco Umbrella has helped make this vision a reality. The interoperability of Umbrella with Room & Board\u2019s existing security infrastructure has enhanced the company\u2019s overall security posture. Room & Board\u2019s internet traffic, from all locations and personnel \u2013 including branch locations, remote workers, and virtual design associates \u2013 points back to Umbrella. Now, Room & Board has the needed security to enable business while monitoring traffic, better understanding their users, and mitigating threats. Umbrella protects customer and company data, while also allowing Room & Board to scale its business and reach a broader audience.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRetailers win with Umbrella\nCisco Umbrella provides visibility and protection across the entire retail network, including in-store, corporate, and e-commerce environments. Umbrella also enables retailers to easily provide safe Wi-Fi connections to everyone accessing the network. Whether you have five or 5,000 locations, administrators can apply a single policy universally across networks to minimize malware, contain bots, and enforce acceptable-use policies throughout all regions.\nMeanwhile, users can simplify security and monitor distributed networks through a centralized dashboard. This enables retailers to safeguard users, devices, and applications across an entire ecosystem.\nHere are critical areas where Umbrella helps retailers win:\n\nSecure in-store Wi-Fi: Retailers often offer Wi-Fi access to customers, but this can create risks if not properly secured. Umbrella blocks users from accessing inappropriate content.\nE-commerce security: Retailers need to protect their customers\u2019 personal and financial information. Umbrella mitigates data exfiltration.\nVisibility into network activity: Umbrella\u2019s real-time network visibility enables retailers to quickly identify and respond to threats. This helps reduce data breaches and remediate incidents faster.\nPhishing attacks: Phishing leads to data breaches. Umbrella blocks access to known and net-new phishing sites, providing an added layer of security beyond email-based controls.\nSimplified security management: Umbrella\u2019s multifunctional DNS-layer, SWG, CASB, DLP and RBI capability is delivered with a single management dashboard, simplifying deployment and security management across the network.\nOperational efficiency: Umbrella is provisioned from the cloud so administrators can change settings via the manager. No more costly site visits or contractors to deploy and keep your edge security current.\n\nBy providing security across the network, from in-store to e-commerce environments, Umbrella helps retailers to protect customer data, optimize operations, and stay ahead of evolving threats.\nLearn more about how Umbrella protects retail\nCheck out the resources Cisco offers to empower hybrid work for retail.\nWant to try Umbrella for yourself?
