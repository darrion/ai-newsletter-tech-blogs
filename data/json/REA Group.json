I\u2019ve survived a whole year at my first ADULT job ever! Cue celebratory music!!\nIt feels like just yesterday I was nervously starting my first day on the job, wondering if I had what it takes to be security person. After being at school for all my life, *cough* (18 years without a gap year) I wasn\u2019t sure if the school life had prepared me enough for joining the workforce.\nThe most accurate way to summarise how I was feeling entering the corporate world would be like:\n\nThe key driving factor of my decision to come to REA was the culture and the people. These are most important to me, as I have always wanted to feel a sense of belonging and purpose. After my first month at REA, I felt seen and important.\nSo, come along with me as I share some things I have learnt in the past year.\nThe beginning\u2026\nWhen I was at school, all sorts of things, milestones, and consequences, were straightforward and with clear measures of success. From my experience, success at school was mostly black and white; if you didn\u2019t demonstrate the steps for your answer, you would not get the marks. I liked that. I became accustomed to having my goals quantifiable and clear.\n\nWhen I entered the corporate world, I struggled with not having any structured syllabus telling me what to do and what my aim should be for the quarter. I found it quite hard to come up with my own milestones. Measuring success became a bit of grey area for me. It took some time to get used to different ways to hold myself accountable, to motivate myself and to define what success looks like for me. After a while, I started to join the dots. I figured out the agile approach to just \u201cdo the project that interests you\u201d. I figured out how that adds value to epics, any interdependences and team\u2019s OKRS. It finally made some sense!\nInitially, I was very intimidated starting in a team of all male engineers. Being a woman in STEM, I had varied experiences back in the university group project days (haven\u2019t we all?)\n\nPun intended.\nBut, to my surprise, I felt welcomed, heard, and acknowledged. I realised that I didn\u2019t have to fit in. Everyone around me provided the space for me to grow, where I could be my true self. I am at a loss for words to express the compassion, kindness, and understanding shown by my teammates. I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to work and learn alongside them daily. I still remember the celebrations when I did my first Git Push, being challenged for even considering working past 5pm, and the genuine appreciation & understanding I received when I made mistakes.\nEven within such a supportive environment, the feeling of imposter syndrome did creep up in me. In the beginning, I felt I had nothing to add to the conversations others were having. That sense of accomplishment at the end of the day was hard to get, as most of my day was filled with googling what others are saying. Even some of the jokes, I couldn\u2019t understand why they were funny!\n\nThankfully, the amazing folks I work with provided me with so much support. I started to feel like I was getting the hang of it all. Even if it made me uncomfortable, I never stopped asking questions. I believe that is one of the hardest but most valuable things anyone can do: ask good questions. I think imposter syndrome is a feeling that doesn\u2019t completely go away, but engaging in things that challenge those thoughts can help.\n\nOne year on\u2026\nTime has flown by quickly since the day I joined, it has been a year already!\nEven after studying cyber security for 2.5 years, I realised there is a big gap between studying and practical application in the real world. In the last year, I have learned to develop opinions on tools, understand how projects, epics, OKRs go hand in hand, pick up a few little annoying GUI features of tools/apps I use regularly, become more detail oriented, use analytical thinking and incorporate a security mindset in my day-to-day life.\nTo explain the big words I used above, I have one little memory to share that will summarise it all. During my first REAio, I excitedly mentioned a burning idea I had to one of my favourite co-workers (Hola amigo Jim). Being the birthday enthusiast, I shared the idea of having a Slackbot that will automatically throw a message in the team channel and wish them Happy Birthday! Jim appreciated my idea and enthusiasm and asked me some series of questions (like he always does).\nHe asked me:\n\nShouldn\u2019t birthdays be kept a secret, as people use it for passwords? Umm, yes.\nDo you give your real birthdate everywhere? Umm, yes.\n\n\nWhich made me stop and realise how much that ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE!! Thanks to Jim, since that conversation I have made my family & friends change their emails as they include their birthdates. Now, every time I am invited to a birthday party l can\u2019t help but say things like, \u201cbetter be no one keeping a note of your birthdate\u201d which leads to me telling people stop putting their birthdates in Instagram bios or their emails.\nIt is safe to say that I am a changed person with a different, more realistic mindset and on I am on the right track to becoming a better security professional.\nHuge shoutout to all of my team for supporting my learning and growth over the past year at REA.\nJoin our Talent Community today to stay up to date on all things Careers at REA.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nTweet about it\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnmol Kaur\n\n\n              View profile\n               for Anmol Kaur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from the blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREA\u2019s Employee Community Grants program\nCategory: Life at REA\nPublished on 17th Jan 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris\u2019s Perspective on Disability and Career at REA\nCategory: Life at REA\nPublished on 4th Dec 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Power of Team Attributes\nCategory: Life at REA\nPublished on 8th Nov 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREA\u2019s SEO team wins international search award\nCategory: Life at REA\nPublished on 27th Oct 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating caring with Prue \u2013 National Carer\u2019s Week\nCategory: Life at REA\nPublished on 19th Oct 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREA Group\u2019s FY23 Sustainability Report and carbon footprint\nCategory: Life at REA\nPublished on 19th Sep 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView all articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nour brands\nWe have businesses in Australia, Asia and North America.
