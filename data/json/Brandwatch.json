Safer Internet Day #SaferInternetDayAs the internet becomes increasingly prominent in our daily lives, so does the need for us to make it a safe place to visit and be a part of for everyone, especially children and young people. Film recommendation: Cyber Bully (2011) (Dir. Charles Binam\u00e9) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafer Internet Day is only three weeks away.

National Send a Card to a Friend Day #SendACardToAFriendDayText messages, voice notes, and videos can do the same job, leaving you feeling all warm and fuzzy at the thoughtfulness of your friend\u2019s gesture. But we\u2019re bringing snail mail and handwritten notes back. Think carefully about the kind of card you\u2019d like to buy, what color pen you\u2019d like to use, and maybe polish up your handwriting. I recently got my friend a \u201cHi Barbie\u201d themed card for her birthday.

On this day, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re team BBQ flavored pizza, team pineapples on pizza, thick crust, or thin\u2026 All that matters is the beauty of the bread and its customizable toppings. It should also be a pretty easy sell to your boss for a pizza party (you\u2019re welcome). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  @comfeeuk Bon apple tea \ud83c\udf55\ud83e\udd0c #mugpizza #microwaverecipe #pizzarecipe #comfee #Nationalpizzaday #Pizza #Pizzaday \u266c original sound - ComfeeUK    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 10. Chinese New Year #LunarNewYear #ChineseNewYearUsher in the year of the Wood Dragon, beginning on February 10, 2024, and concluding on January 28, 2025. The Dragon, which like all other elemental Dragons, comes once every 60 years, is associated with qualities like power, vigor, fiery energy, and exciting possibilities.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 11. Inventors Day #InventorsDayCuriosity, innovation, brilliance. These words might come to mind when you think about inventors and the important work they do. From Da Vinci to Stephanie Kwolek and Henry Ford, we\u2019re glad to have a day dedicated to honoring these great minds and the transformative contributions they\u2019ve made to society. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Tetris (@tetris_official)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 11. International Day of Women and Girls in Science #WomenInScienceLike we just touched on regarding the previous holiday. Women are incredible at science. Stephanie Kwolek, who passed away 10 years ago, was a Polish-American chemist known for inventing Kevlar in the late 1960s. From law & order and hip hop rivalries to action movies, bullet-proof vests made of this material are always front and center. Side note: Kevlar is also used for more applications, like bicycle tires and racing sails.\u00a0We\u2019re excited to recognize the achievements of women and girls in science and encourage the next wave of female scientists to leave their mark on the world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  @cartoonnetwork She.

Super Bowl LVI #SBLV #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowlRihanna made an absolute splash with her Super Bowl halftime performance last year. This time round, we\u2019re excited to see Usher perform. Some viewers tune in for the mini-concert, and others (read: marketers) cannot wait to see the commercials that air (Tubi did not fail to make an impression last year). And, of course, a large demographic tunes in to watch the actual game of American football. Pick your attraction and join in the excitement as we gear up for Super Bowl Sunday 2024. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by FENTY SKIN (@fentyskin)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might like\n\nThe 2024 Digital Marketing Trends\u00a0Report\nThe top 10 need-to-know digital marketing trends of\u00a02024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake me there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13. World Radio Day #WorldRadioDayA tool for communication, education, entertainment, and amplifying cultural expression, the radio has been a friend to society since the turn of the 20th century.

Valentine's Day #ValentinesDayThis might be one of February\u2019s most popular unofficial holidays. From primary school crushes to relationships, marriages, and the like, cupid is always in his element on this day. An insight from Brandwatch Consumer Research: Flowers got more social media mentions than chocolates on Valentine\u2019s Day last year (168k vs 165k). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by EndlessGlo Cosmetics, LLC (@endlessglocosmetics)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 17.

World Whale Day #WorldWhaleDayI\u2019m not sure if the same applies to you, but my key association with whales is the Jonah story from Sunday school. Maybe that\u2019s why World Whale Day is celebrated every third Sunday in February. Either way, it\u2019s clear that these titans of the sea have been around for a long time and need our help with protecting their ocean habitat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Sand Cloud\u00ae\ufe0f (@sandcloud)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 19.

Love Your Pet Day #LoveYourPetDayWe don\u2019t doubt that you do this every day, but some extra attention for your pet couldn\u2019t hurt. Maybe kick back and watch a movie about their kind of animal with them. Hotel for Dogs, Puss in Boots, Ponyo.

International Mother Language Day #IMLDThere are over 7,100 spoken and signed languages in the world, and even more dialects. Just for some perspective, English, only one of these languages, boasts over 160 dialects. It\u2019s imperative that we all make the effort to keep our languages and dialects alive as the threat of their extinction rises.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by AORUS (@aorus_official)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 22. World Thinking Day #WorldThinkingDay\u00a0Surprisingly niche, World Thinking Day was designed for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts to think about their \u201csisters\u201d and the impact of Guiding. This day has been commemorated since February 1926 and is celebrated by Scout and Guide organizations in over 150 countries. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's #WorldThinkingDay & one thing we can't stop thinking about is #Aphantasia, the inability to visualise in your 'mind's eye'.

National Skip the Straw Day #SkiptheStrawDay\u00a0February 23 is all about raising awareness about the damaging effects of single-use plastics, like plastic straws. You can observe this day by abandoning straws altogether or opting for reusable options like stainless steel, bamboo, or glass straws. Albeit single-use, paper straws could also be an option because they\u2019re biodegradable. And if you\u2019re feeling really adventurous, consider going for a pasta straw.
