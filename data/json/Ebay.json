A new eBay feature, powered by generative AI, makes the process of drafting a post as easy as clicking a button. We\u2019re excited to announce AI-generated social media posts.\nThe right social media content can help direct potential buyers to listings; it can connect people in online communities, catch the eye of those who aren\u2019t even actively shopping, and make an individual listing stand out. eBay\u2019s product teams are always working to create innovative experiences for sellers, and our long history working with AI allows us to take advantage of new developments and create new opportunities for sellers \u2013 including optimizing social media exposure.\nWhen sellers visit the Social page in Seller Hub (under the Marketing tab) and start creating a social post, they will see the \u201cUse AI Caption\u201d button next to the text entry box when adding a social media caption. Our\u00a0 generative AI crafts a post about the item being listed, including hashtags and emojis. The seller can prompt the AI to rewrite captions and also manually customize to include any, all, or none of those extra features. Once published, the post also includes a link to the listing(s) along with images of the item to attract new buyers.\n\nThis feature is fully available in the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, allowing sellers to share individual listings, categories, promotions, and stores. We\u2019re seeing a great response from early users.\nSellers love the new feature, with one writing: \u201cJust wanted to say that the generative AI feature in the eBay Social posting tool is a major game changer with social sharing.\u201d\nComing soon is an additional enhancement \u2014 auto-posting. Sellers will be able to choose to automatically post their listings to social media as soon as the listing is published, with no additional action needed. This is just one more way eBay is leveraging innovative technology to help connect people and build communities to empower economic opportunity for all.\n\n\n\n\nTag:\nAutomation\n\n\nPrevious Article: eBay\u2019s first Chief AI Officer Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov Recognized in Insider\u2019s AI 100 List\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nMaking online commerce smarter and more efficient.\n\nMore Articles\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\u2018Magical\u2019 Listing Tool Harnesses the Power of AI to Make Selling on eBay Faster, Easier, and More Accurate\nSep  7, 2023 \n\n\nThe Staging Dichotomy: Part Two\nDec  8, 2021 \n\n\nThe Staging Dichotomy: Part One\nDec  6, 2021 \n\n\neBay Launches Targeted Auto Retry\nApr  9, 2021 \n\n\nHow eBay Leverages Kubernetes, Helm Charts and Jenkins Pipelines to Deliver High-Quality Software\nApr  5, 2021 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neBay.com\nPress Room\nFollow Us\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nHome\nCompany\nStories\nImpact\nInnovation\nInvestors\nCareers\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1995-2024 eBay Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nTerms of Use\n|\nPrivacy\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nSettlements\n\n\n\neBay.com\nPress Room\nFollow Us\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n",
