Recent enhancements include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simplified container registry validation</strong>: With a complete redesign of the container registry experience, it\u2019s much easier for users to link their container registries to Paperspace. Simply select the container registry vendor (Dockerhub, Azure CR, Google CR, or Github CR), fill in the namespace, username/password or access token, and we will prefill the other values required to connect the registry to Paperspace. This provides improved management of existing container registries and adds a new way to add containers into Gradient Deployments to ensure successful deployment starts, streamlining the container registry experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced security for deployment endpoints</strong>: We have fortified the deployment endpoints for Paperspace to provide enhanced security for Gradient Deployments.  When creating a deployment, you can choose whether to set the endpoint to public or protected. By selecting protected status, you can easily manage permissions and have more control over who can access the endpoints. You also have the option to switch between public and protected endpoints as needed. <a href=\"https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/deployments/security/\">Check out our docs to learn more</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"build-and-grow-your-ai-powered-business-on-paperspace\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#build-and-grow-your-ai-powered-business-on-paperspace\">Build and grow your AI-powered business on Paperspace</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#build-and-grow-your-ai-powered-business-on-paperspace\"></a></h2>\n<p>We\u2019re excited about the new customer offerings on the Paperspace platform and remain committed to delivering excellent experiences for AI/ML businesses. <a href=\"https://console.paperspace.com/machines/create?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=do-blog&amp;utm_campaign=h100\">Click here to get started</a> or <a href=\"http://paperspace.com/nvidia-h100?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=do-blog&amp;utm_campaign=h100\">contact our sales team</a> to learn more about how Paperspace can help your business grow.</p>",
