And one way you may be thinking of making self-care a core part of your new year. But what does self-care really look like in your day-to-day life?\nSelf-care is a lot of things, and the debate over its true meaning and utility has spurred a lot of hot takes in recent years. It\u2019s gotten a bad reputation lately as a way for people to ignore the world and put the mselves before others, but that\u2019s not what self-care is really about. Sometimes it\u2019s actions like buying a treat or taking a bath. Sometimes it\u2019s drinking enough water and getting sufficient sleep. Sometimes it\u2019s doing things that are kind of unpleasant in the moment that you know will lead to improved conditions down the line. In almost every case, self-care is simply whatever\u2019s going to support your physical and mental health and prevent longer-term burnout.\nThough the total commodification of self-care is pretty recent, self-care as a concept isn\u2019t all that new. Socrates may have been one of the first major thinkers to lay the groundwork for the notion that we have to fill our own cups first before tending to others. It eventually took on political overtones in the 1970s and 80s within queer and POC communities. Activist Audre Lorde famously said that \u201ccaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\u201d\nThe contemporary self-care movement is also somewhat political. It might be trendy, but it became especially trendy in the weeks following the November 2016 election in the United States. In the years since, we\u2019ve also become familiar with a number of other wellness words that often have psychological or mental health implications. Because these concepts can often be kind of obtuse and prone to being overused to the point of meaninglessness, here are some working definitions to help you understand the universe of self-care. Then, you might be able to carry these ideas into 2024 and see what a new you really looks like.\nSelf-Care Vocabulary, Defined\nBoundaries\nCulturally, we are recognizing the need to have healthy boundaries with others. Often, you have to recognize (and then name) your limits first to do this, and there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach, which is why it\u2019s not always simple to define \u201cboundaries.\u201d For one person, it may look like not giving in to pressure to respond to texts or emails immediately. For another person, it may look like saying \u201cno\u201d to friends or family members who ask for financial favors, or perhaps ending a conversation when it becomes hurtful or abusive.\nBoundaries are an important component of self-care because looking out for yourself is not always about what you do, but also what you don\u2019t agree to do (or take responsibility for).\nValid\n\u201cYour feelings are valid.\u201d \u201cThanks for validating me.\u201d \u201cI feel like you\u2019re invalidating my lived experience.\u201d You may have heard these phrases, or variations thereof, populating the discourse of years past. For something to be valid, it has to be relevant, meaningful and grounded in some semblance of truth. In the past, \u201cvalid\u201d was often used to describe things with legal or logical validity, but its common application to the murkier emotional realms is a little more recent. And to understand this usage, it\u2019s probably necessary to talk about why we would need to affirm the legitimacy of feelings or subjective truths.\nA lot of times, insisting that \u201cfeelings are valid\u201d is meant to counteract the tendency to elevate rational thinking above emotional thinking (to the point that our heads override our hearts completely). And sometimes, it\u2019s in response to gaslighting \u2014 another popular buzzword \u2014 which is a manipulation tactic people use to make others feel like they can\u2019t count on their own perceptions. Sometimes, \u201cvalid\u201d is used to make a statement \u2014 one that legitimizes identities or perspectives that are marginalized in society.\n\u201cFeelings are valid\u201d often comes with a disclaimer, however. Emotions are real and worth paying attention to, but they\u2019re not always an appropriate response to the situation at hand. To say emotions are \u201cvalid\u201d is not to give carte blanche to throw gratuitous temper tantrums. It\u2019s more about reminding people not to ignore or discredit their feelings.\nCleanse\nTypically, you see \u201ccleanse\u201d used interchangeably with \u201cdetox,\u201d often in the context of a temporary diet meant to purge your body of toxins and impurities. Of course, you could take issue with the purported science behind some of these cleanses, as well as the meaning of the word \u201cdetox\u201d in this context. Livers do our detoxing automatically, and the boost in energy you might receive from doing a cleanse is not necessarily the same as the physical process of clearing toxins from your system.\nHowever, \u201ccleanse\u201d can also apply to lots of things beyond nutrition. You can do a social media cleanse by unfollowing accounts that provoke your anxiety or simply taking time away from the internet. You can perform a cleanse of your living space by giving it the Marie Kondo treatment or getting rid of things you associate with negative memories. Any area of your life that\u2019s prone to accumulating literal or metaphorical dust is fair game for a cleanse.\nUnplug\nIn line with the concept of an internet cleanse, our tech-saturated society has created a world that we occasionally need to \u201cunplug\u201d from. To unplug for a bit can mean literally shutting off your electronic devices to get a mental health break from the barrage of constant updates, internet junk and pressure of being \u201cwatched\u201d all the time.\nYou don\u2019t have to get off the grid to unplug in the new year. Instead, unplugging can be simply turning off notifications for your busiest apps, putting a ban on checking work emails after you\u2019ve left the office, or avoiding a specific social media platform for a set amount of time.\nBurnout\nOur work culture puts a lot of pressure on people to maximize their productivity at all times, which is often more than what the average person\u2019s physical and mental health comfortably allows for. The onus to stay late at the office, sometimes work multiple jobs, and still excel in every other area of life can all lead to a state of total exhaustion we\u2019ve dubbed \u201cburnout.\u201d\nYou can be in a state of constant stress for a long time leading up to the point of burnout, but usually, by the time you\u2019re there, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve been in prolonged \u201cfight or flight\u201d mode for long enough that you simply don\u2019t have it in you to keep going like that. Part of the purported goal of self-care is to prevent this sort of burnout.\nBuzzFeed writer Anne Helen Petersen sparked a specific conversation around the way young people specifically experience burnout \u2014 a.k.a. \u201cMillennial Burnout.\u201d The combination of poor economic prospects, crushing debt, the constant demand for our attention online, and being raised to optimize every aspect of our lives have all led to a state of \u201cerrand paralysis\u201d that can make seemingly simple tasks, like mailing a package, feel so daunting that Millennials avoid going to the post office altogether.\nHold Space\nWhat does it mean to \u201chold space\u201d for someone? And what does it mean to \u201chold space\u201d for the possibility of things to come?\nTo \u201chold space\u201d is to provide a receptive container for another person to vent their feelings, or for new possibilities you haven\u2019t fully entertained or anticipated. This implies that in order for someone to have a proper catharsis with someone else, they need to feel witnessed. And that in order to accept a possibility you weren\u2019t expecting, you need to turn off your constant drive to \u201cknow things\u201d and \u201cmake things happen\u201d and allow some elbow room for everything that\u2019s beyond the narrow scope of your own will.\nIn a way, this is sort of just a new age way of describing the concept of \u201clistening.\u201d Too often, we\u2019re inclined to talk over others or make the conversation about ourselves. Instead, when you hold space for someone, you give them your quiet presence and attention.\nLearn a new language today.TRY BABBEL Share:Steph KoyfmanSteph is a senior content producer who has spent over five years writing about language and culture for Babbel.
