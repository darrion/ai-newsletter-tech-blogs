So we\u2019re hosting a virtual hackathon to help you learn how to build your own RAG chat app with Python!\n.\nFrom January 29th to February 12th, we\u2019ll host live streams showing you how to build on our most popular RAG chat sample repository, while also explaining the core concepts underlying all modern RAG chat apps. Live stream topics will include vector search, access control, GPT-4 with vision. We\u2019re hoping to get developers from all over the world involved, so we\u2019ll also have live streams in Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese. There will be prizes for the best chat apps, and even a prize for our most helpful community member.\nTo learn more, visit the AI Chat App Hack page, and follow the steps there to register and meet the community.
