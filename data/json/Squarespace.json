To learn more, see the Intro post and Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the tutorial.\n\n\n\nKEY TERMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            App\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, an app represents a single piece of software that\u2019s provided for others to use. This could be a mobile app, a web app, a microservice, a database, an API, a Figma component library, a React component library, a script, and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Target audience\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group of people who are most likely to use the app. For example, if the app is an API, the target audience is likely to be only developers. Whereas the target audience for a Figma component library is designers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Technical documentation\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny piece of writing that includes technical writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you didCongratulations \ud83c\udf89 You just drafted, revised, and published a piece of technical documentation that will help your reader\u2019s get the most out of your app. And you should feel confident in this statement because your technical documentation is:Specific to your reader\u2019s goalOrganized and structuredAccurate, consistent, and concisePolished because you tested and edited it But as you worked on your document, you might have thought:It\u2019s clear I need to create more documents\u2026 but how should I organize them?All this is great for new documentation\u2026 but what about existing documentation?I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more to learn\u2026 is there a course on technical writing?Well, fret not!What\u2019s nextHow to organize a collection of documentsOrganizing a collection of documents under labels is known as information architecture (IA)\u00b9. To start, use this basic IA for your app. Notice how the labels mirror the content types. For demo purposes:Directories or folders have a forward slash like /a-directoryFiles or pages use the format a-page.ext\n\nBasic IA\n------------------------------------\nget-started.ext\n/tutorials\n  \u21b3 a-tutorial.ext\n  \u21b3 another-tutorial.ext\n/how-tos\n  \u21b3 a-how-to.ext\n  \u21b3 another-how-to.ext\n/explanations (or /topic, /concepts)\n  \u21b3 a-concept.ext\n  \u21b3 a-topic.ext\n/reference\n  \u21b3 an-element.ext\n  \u21b3 another-element.ext\ntroubleshooting.ext\nsupport.ext\nglossary.ext\n\nNotice how there\u2019s a Support page.  A support page details how readers can reach the team who supports the app. This page isn\u2019t a content type, but it\u2019s strongly recommended in any IA.\n\n\n\nHow to revise existing documentation\n\n\n\nRevising existing documentation is a little tricky because a simple, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just move this here\u2026\u201d can morph into an \u201cOMG, I need to rewrite every. single. word.\u201d  To prevent this, I recommend the following approach:Determine the target audience for the documentation; doing this will make your content updates much more focused.Determine the goal of the documentation; this will help you determine the true\u00b2 content type.Is it to get started? \u2192 Getting started Is it to teach or demo something? \u2192 TutorialIs it to provide instructions for a specific task? \u2192 How-toIs it to explain a topic or concept? \u2192 Explanation Is it to provide specifications about a software element? \u2192 Reference  Is it to provide solutions for errors? \u2192 TroubleshootingReorganize the existing content; use the skills you learned in Part 2.Update the existing content; use the guidelines you learned in Part 3.Revise and publish the updated\u00b3 content; use the process from Part 4.The approach doesn\u2019t include creating a glossary \u2013 this is on purpose. In my god-awful experience, the minute I decide to create a glossary, my updates to a single piece of technical documentation balloons across the entire documentation set and much more. \ud83d\ude29 Creating a glossary and updating any related documentation should be a separate, focused effort.How to expand your technical writing skillsHere are some of my favorite resources; also recommended by many peers.Technical Writing for Developers; a free, self-paced course by GoogleDocs for Developers: An Engineer\u2019s field guide to Technical Writing; great, approachable bookModern Technical Writing; \u201cDon\u2019t write\u201d as the third heading in the table of contents had me verklemptIf you\u2019d like to practice your writing skills in the real world, I think Google Season of Docs is a fantastic way to get started with the open-source community.Another way to expand your skills is through the technical writing community. I wholeheartedly encourage you to join the WriteTheDocs Slack network even if you\u2019re shy about your skills. I\u2019m always learning and relearning by the discussions in the various channels. I\u2019ve also sent technical writing bloggers such as Tom Johnson emails about challenging documentation projects and have received thoughtful, sincere feedback.As long as you\u2019re engaged in the technical writing community, you\u2019ll still grow as a technical writer even if you\u2019re not actively writing. \ud83e\udd29Last wordsI hope this tutorial on technical writing was approachable and amusing. If you\u2019d like to know more about the field in general, or if you\u2019d like to befriend someone who loves Oxford commas and can debate the logic behind it, feel free to send a note!I have to end this series with a note to others:  Youenn Pennarun, Casey Brown, Robb Romans, Eva Parish, Mark Marchione, and Tom Drapeau for working your magic to make this happen. You\u2019re all rock stars \ud83d\udd7afor helping me with words #englishishard\n\n\n\n\u00b9 That\u2019s the definition I provided for this tutorial \u2013 there are many definitions for information architecture (IA). It\u2019s because the field intersects technology, design, and science and merits its own World IA Day. For what it\u2019s worth, we learn to organize and label something before speaking \u2013 who knew?! (Thank you Abby Covert for making IA less intimidating.)\u00b2 In my experience, most existing documentation tries to meet more than one reader\u2019s goal. When this happens, documentation is verbose, difficult to scan, and not specific. This is why a reader may become frustrated with documentation, and in turn, the app.\u00b3 After you update a single piece of existing documentation, you may be beset with a strong desire to revamp the \u201cwhole shebang\u201d. Documentation revamps are better known as content inventory and audits. The Nielsen Norman Group has a thorough article on the process.\n\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\nTake a look at our open roles \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook0\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n0 Likes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\nHome RSS\n\n\nLatest Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\n\n\nOutro: What You Did and What\u2019s Next\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 4: Test, Edit, And Publish Content\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnila Zaidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec  5 Part 4: Test, Edit, And Publish Content\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 14\n\n\n\nNov 14 \n                      Part 1: Learn The Different Types Of Technical Documentation\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 28\n\n\n\nNov 28 \n                      Part 3: Draft Content That\u2019s Accurate, Consistent, And Concise\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec  5\n\n\n\nDec  5 \n                      Part 4: Test, Edit, And Publish Content\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCTSDomainsWebsitesOnline StoresG SuiteMobile AppsLogosPricingFeature IndexLogin\n\n\n\nCOMPANYAboutCareersCustomersPress & MediaService StatusTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyContact Us\n\n\n\nCOMMUNITYHelp & SupportAnswersWorkshopsSpecialistsDevelopersCircle\n\n\n\nFOLLOWSquarespace BlogEngineering BlogInstagramFacebookTwitterGoogle Plus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
