A couple of times per year we slow down our normal work and spend a week working on scratching a personal itch or features we want as user and see how far we can get with our hacks. One thing from the last Hack Day in March made it all the way to production: redesigning how direct messaging looks on Tumblr! Pretty cool!Here are some of the projects that got made for this most recent Hack Week in September. Some of these things you may also end up seeing on the site\u2026Tumblr PatioMaybe this will look familiar to you, but we love this idea of being able to organize Tumblr feeds into many \u201ccolumns\u201d side-by-side, creating a very dense but lively view of Tumblr. Lenny, Kelly, and Paul hacked this together, and we\u2019re pretty excited to see where it\u2019ll go. Each column can be a different feed on Tumblr, like For You, Following, your Activity, a specific blog, a search, Trending, even a Collection, so many possibilities!Tumblr BoothsMeanwhile, a separate team of @autoplanes, Katie, @lex, Shaun, and Eve dug into the idea of selling digital and physical goods through blogs on Tumblr, leveraging our sibling platform WooCommerce! Blogs could put whatever they\u2019d like for sale here, and have a dedicated space for it. We know there are so many amazing artists and artisans here who could use this to more easily sell their creations on Tumblr!Avatar Frames/HatsThis one is a golden oldie, it keeps coming back hack day after hack day, and each time it gets even better. Santi and Maxime hacked together some example avatar \u201cframes\u201d and \u201chats\u201d that folks on Tumblr could purchase for their blog. Maybe eventually people could create these and sell them or gift them to each other!As always, stay tuned to the @changes blog to see if any of these hacks make it on Tumblr for real!\n\n\ntumblr engineering\ntumblr hack week\ntumblr hack day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n437 notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamBuilder: our open-source framework for powering your dashboard.Today, we\u2019re abnormally jazzed to announce that we\u2019re open-sourcing the custom framework we built to power your dashboard on Tumblr. We call it StreamBuilder, and we\u2019ve been using it for many years.First things first. What is open-sourcing? Open sourcing is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration. In more accessible language, it is any program whose source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit.What, then, is StreamBuilder? Well, every time you hit your Following feed, or For You, or search results, a blog\u2019s posts, a list of tagged posts, or even check out blog recommendations, you\u2019re using this framework under the hood. If you want to dive into the code, check it out here on GitHub!StreamBuilder has a lot going on. The primary architecture centers around \u201cstreams\u201d of content: whether posts from a blog, a list of blogs you\u2019re following, posts using a specific tag, or posts relating to a search. These are separate kinds of streams, which can be mixed together, filtered based on certain criteria, ranked for relevancy or engagement likelihood, and more.On your Tumblr dashboard today you can see how there are posts from blogs you follow, mixed with posts from tags you follow, mixed with blog recommendations. Each of those is a separate stream, with its own logic, but sharing this same framework. We inject those recommendations at certain intervals, filter posts based on who you\u2019re blocking, and rank the posts for relevancy if you have \u201cBest stuff first\u201d enabled. Those are all examples of the functionality StreamBuilder affords for us.So, what\u2019s included in the box?The full framework library of code that we use today, on Tumblr, to power almost every feed of content you see on the platform.A YAML syntax for composing streams of content, and how to filter, inject, and rank them.Abstractions for programmatically composing, filtering, ranking, injecting, and debugging streams.Abstractions for composing streams together\u2014such as with carousels, for streams-within-streams.An abstraction for cursor-based pagination for complex stream templates.Unit tests covering the public interface for the library and most of the underlying code.What\u2019s still to comeDocumentation. We have a lot to migrate from our own internal tools and put in here!More example stream templates and example implementations of different common streams.If you have questions, please check out the code and file an issue there.\n\n\nopensource\nengineering\ntumblr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3,841 notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr Hack Day, March 2023 Edition\nWell well well, it was Hack Day once again at Tumblr. A few times per year we slow down our normal work and spend a day (or sometimes a whole week) working on whatever we want and see how far we can get with our hacks. Here are some of the projects that got made for our most recent Hack Day earlier this month. Some of these things you may also end up seeing on the site\u2026Wesley worked on adding the ability to translate the text content of posts using LibreTranslate, which works really well! We know this is a big pain point for folks who use Tumblr around the world, so we\u2019re excited to keep experimenting with this.Omar built a Feature Wishlist for the Android app, which has different lists for community-driven and staff-driven feature ideas, with the ability to upvote which ones you\u2019d like the most! Really cool, we\u2019re trying to think of ways like this to expand what we can do to collaborate with the community, like we already do with the @wip and @changes blogs.One thing that\u2019s been bugging @blowery forever is trying to figure out who exactly added the tags when you\u2019re viewing a reblog of a post. It can be hard to tell whether the person reblogging it added the tags, or if they\u2019re meant to come from the reblogged post. To help distinguish this, they hacked together putting the reblogger\u2019s avatar next to the tags they added at the bottom of their reblog!@straku hacked together a more modern look for our 1:1 messaging on Tumblr, bringing the message bubbles into a left-and-right back-and-forth format, and using some better colors. Looks a lot snazzier!As always, stay tuned to the @changes blog to see if any of these hacks make it on Tumblr for real!\n\n\ntumblr engineering\ntumblr hack day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n251 notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr Hack Day, December 2022 Edition\nAh yes, it was Hack Day once again at Tumblr. A few times per year we slow down our normal work and spend a day (or sometimes a whole week) working on whatever we want and see how far we can get with our hacks. The main star of the last Hack Week was\u2026 pretty much all of them!Here are some of the projects that got made for our most recent Hack Day earlier this month. Some of these things you may also end up seeing on the site\u2026@yi5h worked on a huge suite of \u201crewards\u201d that folks on Tumblr could unlock by doing various things on the platform, such as reblogging, creating content, even just logging in! Maybe you could earn badges this way to put on your blog\u2026@straku hacked together a new way of viewing reblog trails. We commonly get feedback that reblog trails are difficult to understand, so styling them differently to make the information clearer is fun to try out!Meanwhile, Evgeniy built a beautifully simple \u201cBack to Top\u201d button for the Android app, which does exactly what it sounds like: brings you back to the top of whatever feed you\u2019re currently viewing. No more scrolling, scrolling, scrolling \u2014 just one tap!As always, stay tuned to the @changes blog to see if any of these hacks make it on Tumblr for real!\n\n\ntumblr engineering\ntumblr hack day\ntumblr hack week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n276 notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr Hack Week, September 2022 Edition\nIt was Hack Week (more than just a day!) once again at Tumblr! A couple of times per year we slow down our normal work and spend a week working on whatever we want and see how far we can get with our hacks. The main star of the last Hack Week was the \u201cSummon crab!\u201d button, and we loved it so much that we rolled it out not just for April Fools this year, but we made it our first gift-able widget in TumblrMart!Here are some of the projects that got made for this most recent Hack Week in September. Some of these things you may also end up seeing on the site\u2026Tumbeast Digital PetBen worked on adding our friendly server room Tumbeasts to Tumblr as a cute little digital pet. You can feed them and play with them, and they poop and get unhappy and need tending, of course. Who wouldn\u2019t want one of these to take care of every day on Tumblr, forever and ever?Tumblr Blaze on TumblrMart@adalpari added Tumblr Blaze as a gift-able item in TumblrMart, which would allow folks to buy Blaze \u201ccredits\u201d for other people. Perfect for those times you see an amazing post on Tumblr that definitely deserves to be spread around, and you don\u2019t mind throwing some money at letting that person have a chance to spread it via Blaze!User Account Switcher@yi5h hacked together an account switcher for the web, so that folks can log in to more than one Tumblr account and easily switch back and forth between them. Super handy if you have one account for your roleplaying character, and another for your Star Trek fandom discussions. Very useful!Tumblr CollectionsOn web as well, Jo\u00e3o made a version of an idea that\u2019s floated around many times, the idea of being able to organize posts on Tumblr into \u201ccollections\u201d that can be named and shared. I think everyone would very much enjoy having a collection called \u201cwaves\u201d that\u2019s just soothing GIFs of ocean waves.As always, stay tuned to the @changes blog to see if any of these hacks make it on Tumblr for real!\n\n\ntumblr engineering\ntumblr hack day\ntumblr hack week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,908 notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking GIFs load faster\nAKA why are some of my GIFs being turned into videos?OverviewWe\u2019re experimenting with serving GIFs as MP4 videos instead of GIFV (which typically serves animated WebP) on the web to a small subset of folks on Tumblr, not everyone. This does not affect anyone using the mobile apps.The performance improvements from using MP4s in this way are huge, and will make Tumblr load animated images faster and use less data in almost every circumstance, with no discernible loss in quality.This conversion only applies to specific types of GIFs, such as ones without transparency in the first frame. We\u2019ve tested this conversion on thousands of GIFs, and we\u2019re still tuning it to be virtually indistinguishable from the original GIF.XKit\u2019s \u201cVanilla Videos\u201d extension was causing a bug with this experiment, but a recent new XKit version release has fixed that issue.If you\u2019re served an MP4 instead of a GIF, clicking on the image will still open it in a lightbox, which you can download as GIFV or GIF, depending on what\u2019s served.Since this is still just an experiment, there is no way to opt-out yet; adding some kind of opt-out (on the creator and/or consumer side) is a possibility though.If you\u2019re served a GIF as MP4 and it looks wrong, please contact Support with a link to the image and what looks wrong about the conversion. We need examples to help us improve the experience. Also, please do not send duplicate support requests.Keep reading\n\n\ntumblr update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2,492 notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr Hack Week, March 2022 Edition\nIt was Hack Week (more than just a day!) once again at  Tumblr! A couple of times per year we grind everything to a halt and spend a week working on whatever we want and see how far we can get with  our hacks. Since last time, we\u2019ve launched the ability to have a Discord => Tumblr integration, we\u2019re close to launching Twitch embed support, and custom logos are now possible in the mobile apps! And from a previous Hack Day, we\u2019ve launched \u201cTimestamps Everywhere\u201d on web, and we\u2019re working on rolling it out to the mobile apps very soon!Here are some of the projects that got made for this last Hack Week.  Some of these things you may also end up seeing on the site\u2026Interacting as a Sideblog/Secondary blog@designpatternpirate put together a proof of concept for switching to a sideblog/secondary  blog when liking or replying to posts.

It is hard to believe that HTTPS was essentially opt-in, if available at all! Back then, people also had to get creative when inventing means to delegate access to someone else. One solution was OAuth 1, conceived by the IETF, later adopted by Tumblr in 2011.Time went by, and here we are in 2021, with hardly any popular website not shielded with HTTPS (including your own blog!). Today, it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to adopt OAuth 1 as inconvenient as it is. Yet here we are, still asking people to use outdated protocols for their new fancy Tumblr apps. Not anymore!Starting today, you have another option: we\u2019re officially opening up OAuth 2 support for the Tumblr API!Get startedOAuth 2 flow requires you to know two key URIs:For authorization requests, you should use /oauth2/authorizeTo exchange authorization codes and refresh tokens, you\u2019ll need to use /v2/oauth2/tokenIf you\u2019re familiar with OAuth 2, register an application and check out our API documentation (specifically the section on OAuth 2) to get up and running.The future of OAuth 1There are no plans to shut down OAuth 1. Your app will continue to work as usual. But be sure to keep an eye on this blog just in case anything new pops up that would prevent us from serving OAuth 1 requests.What\u2019s more, if you wish to adopt OAuth 2 in your app, given its superior simplicity, you don\u2019t have to migrate entirely to OAuth 2 at once. Instead, you can keep the old sign-up / log-in flow working, and exchange OAuth 1 access token to OAuth 2 tokens on the fly. There\u2019s only one catch: this exchange will invalidate the original access token, so you should be using only the OAuth 2 Bearer authentication for any subsequent requests.Next stepsWe\u2019ll be adding support for OAuth 2 to our API clients in the coming months. Follow this blog to learn firsthand when this happens.Although we do support client-side OAuth 2 flow, we can\u2019t recommend using it unless absolutely required. We might harden it with PKCE someday, though.That\u2019s all from us today.
