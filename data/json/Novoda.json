Here\u2019s what it means for our clients and impact.\n\n\n\n        Good Business            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Scroll down    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Carl-Gustaf Harroch and Julia Zaman\nIt\u2019s official, Novoda has joined the ranks of more than 7,000 businesses in 92 countries that have achieved B Corp certification. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of our team who have worked so hard to get us here, or more excited for what B Corp accreditation represents for the future of Novoda.\nBecoming part of the B Lab global network means that we\u2019re now part of a group of purpose-led, forward-thinking, conscious businesses whose mission is to transform the global economy to the benefit of people, communities and the planet.\u00a0\nNow, that\u2019s a big mission! So, let\u2019s break it down and get a bit more personal about what B Corp status means for us and our clients.\n\nWhat B Corp means to us\nWhen we embarked on the Novoda rebrand, we knew we wanted to put doing good at the core of our business. We wanted to have a purpose that every single person in the company could unite behind. We had ambitious goals, and we were looking for a framework to help us achieve them \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what B Corp has been for us.\nJoining the B Corp community has also opened the doors to an incredible network of like-minded business owners who share our philosophy when it comes to business for good, and who continually inspire us to keep learning and improving.\nWhat\u2019s more, having official recognition from B Lab gives us the confidence that we\u2019re doing all we can to be a sustainable, ethical, person-centred business. Of course, there\u2019s always room for improvement, and being part of the B Corp community helps us to keep thinking about the positive changes we can make now and in the future.\n\n\u201cThe B Corp accreditation is the main reason I joined Novoda. I was drawn to work here because I have an innate desire to create a positive impact in the world, and I saw an opportunity for that.\u201d\u00a0\nSarah Gruneisen, Director of Engineering\nWhat B Corp has taught us\nOne of our biggest learnings from the B Corp process is that it\u2019s within the power of ANY business \u2013 no matter your sector \u2013 to do good. We\u2019re certainly not the same company that started this process, we\u2019ve learned and reframed so much of what we believe and how we operate along the way.\nWe\u2019ve always known that the people who work at Novoda are what makes us so special \u2013 and it\u2019s been incredible to see how everyone has banded together during the B Corp process, wholeheartedly embracing all the changes we\u2019ve made along the way. Knowing we\u2019ve made this happen together has hugely strengthened our team.\u00a0\nThere is something incredibly empowering about coming to work and knowing you\u2019re doing good in the world \u2013 that\u2019s not an opportunity everyone gets. Going through the process has strengthened our foundational principles and positively impacted how we work together, the work we do and the decisions we make.\nBut the process has also taught us that there is still work to be done. We want to go above and beyond the B Corp requirements. For us, this process was much more than a tick-box exercise, and we\u2019ll continue to focus on making more impact in our strongest areas of community, learning, wellbeing and reward.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow B Corp has changed our approach to business\nOur identity as a B Corp has become a fundamental part of how we operate \u2013 it\u2019s not just a tag on to business as usual. We take pride in the fact that, together with thousands of other businesses around the world, we are working together to create something better.\nIt\u2019s important to us that the clients we work with share our values and intentions, and we\u2019re looking forward to our B Corp journey becoming a key part of our sales and marketing conversations. Having the accreditation means we can step confidently into these discussions and demonstrate our commitment to the B Corp vision for an inclusive, equitable and regenerative global economy in everything we do.\nInterestingly, we\u2019ve met very few fellow tech companies that have achieved B Corp status \u2013 but we want to see more of them. We believe that when you combine innovation in technology with a vision for a better world, incredible things can happen.\u00a0\nFor example, we would love to dig deeper into how technology can be used as a force for good in the areas of privacy, democracy and equality. Big tech has a bad reputation in these areas, but they need to be tackled \u2013 and we hope to see more funding and investment become available for this kind of work in the future.\n\n\u201cAs part of the B Corp process, we had to sign a declaration of interdependence, showing that we are committed to working together with other businesses to make something better. I love this idea.\u201d\nCarl-Gustaf Harroch, Founder & MD\nHow becoming a B Corp benefits our clients\n\nFirst and foremost, we are humans \u2013 it\u2019s always been the case at Novoda, but now it\u2019s written into the fabric of how we do business.\u00a0\nWe bring the human touch into everything we do \u2013 we aren\u2019t robots with a rate card, we bring genuinely creative thinking that adds huge value to our clients. B Corp has given us a framework to align our products with our purpose, which isn\u2019t the case for most agencies.\u00a0\nAs a team, we\u2019re feeling motivated and inspired to apply our values to every single project we work on in the future and make great things happen as a result.\nConsidering becoming a B Corp? \nHere\u2019s our advice\u2026\n\nStart now! It\u2019s a long process and there\u2019s no time like the present to get started on the journey. It will have a huge impact on your business and will prompt deep reflections that can be transformative.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t think you\u2019re ready? Look at your business carefully and be open to the possibility that you can have more of an impact than you think.\nLean on and engage with the incredible B Corp community throughout your accreditation and beyond \u2013 the fellow businesses we\u2019ve met have been amazing, leading us to excellent conversations and ideas on how to implement our ideas and aspirations.\nIf you\u2019re a service-based company, it\u2019s easy to think you don\u2019t have that many emissions \u2013 but you still do! We did a carbon footprinting workshop and it was eye-opening, one of our biggest impacts (and easiest to reduce) was from banking, which many businesses don\u2019t think about.\nB-Corp is just the first step, together as businesses we have the potential to do so much more good in the world!\n\nWant to find out more about working with us?\nBook a discovery call and let\u2019s talk about making good things happen for your business and in the world.\n\n\n\n\n Share\n\n\nCopied\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook  \n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn  \n\n\n\nShare on Twitter  \n\n\n\n Copy URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovoda \n\n\n\nNovoda LTD\r\n86-90 Paul Street\r\nLondon EC2A 4NE\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\nReg.
