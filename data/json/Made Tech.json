A family member visits and wants to help. They find the council\u2019s online portal where you can log a repair in minutes. Sounds great. However, there\u2019s a problem: you need to login and they don\u2019t have an account\u2026\nThis is a familiar situation from our conversations and research with over 100 residents across multiple councils in the North and South of England. When we asked residents why they don\u2019t use existing report-a-repair online services, it was often down to one thing \u2013 having to remember and enter a username and password.\nBetter and quicker resolution for everyone\nLogging housing repairs is an emotive subject. That leaking tap? You want it fixed quickly so that it\u2019s one less thing to worry about. Having a login is a barrier and that barrier implies it\u2019s easier and quicker to call. However, when a digital service is well designed it\u2019s easier to report online and quickly triage it to offer the resident an appointment slot that best suits them \u2013 all in minutes. I\u2019ll throw another number into the mix \u2013 calling isn\u2019t quicker, it takes an average of 18 minutes to report by phone (with a 9 minute waiting time) and is often only available 9-5. And we know taps have a habit of leaking outside these hours.\nSome of the most vulnerable people in society live in social housing. They\u2019re reliant on others, like family members, wardens or other support networks. Removing the login opens the door for that support network to report repairs on their behalf.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s another inclusivity aspect that came out of the research and testing we did and that\u2019s people who have accessibility needs or those for whom English isn\u2019t their first language.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier to log something online with accessibility tools such as screen readers, increased font size and built-in translators, especially if the wording and journey has been road-tested with these user groups in mind.\u00a0\u00a0\nCompare this to having to ring up. It\u2019s more time, more hassle and more frustration. Of course there are benefits in telephone conversations and this should remain an option.\u00a0Offering an online option frees up these channels and reduces wait time for those that need it most. I\u2019m not suggesting that there isn\u2019t a time and a place to use the phone but in the above example it wouldn\u2019t be the easiest or most user-friendly first point of contact.\nMisconception 1: Will users abuse the service?\nA common barrier to no login is that residents will want to report multiple issues, including non-repairs related ones. So as well as the leaky tap they\u2019ll also ask who their councillor is, when the bins are being emptied and so on. Yet during our research we found that over 95% calls were related to a single repair issue.\nMisconception 2: We need a login for security\nThen there\u2019s security, another reason cited for needing a login. We\u2019ve worked with several councils without a login process and there hasn\u2019t been a single rogue repair logged. The idea that someone will sit there and log fictitious faults is one that hasn\u2019t materialised.\u00a0\nOne perception is that there will be less misuse and security risks if people have to ring in and speak to a customer service agent versus logging things online. When listening to hundreds of calls, most council agents only asked for an address as verification. Meaning that without psychic powers there\u2019s no additional checks via the phone reporting route.\nLogin or no login \u2013 can the 2 live side-by-side?\nOf course there is another point to consider when it comes to login or no login. And this takes me back to one of my earlier points around considering user needs. There will be people who live in social housing who simply want to log a repair and get visibility of this one thing.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also residents who need to regularly check their rent balances and other council information that from a user experience and trust perspective needs to sit behind a login. This doesn\u2019t mean that if they need to quickly log a repair they can\u2019t access this via the route with no login. The two options can co-exist.\nSupport people to use the service \u2013 promote it!\nThe final piece in this applies whether you put your repairs behind a login or not. And this is making sure your tenants are aware of the online service. How can you encourage them to use it? What information and help do they need?\u00a0\u00a0\nLook at all the usual touch points, like rent statements, tenant sign up, IVR messaging and use these to promote the online service. From user research, I\u2019ve seen that people are more likely to trust a phone call over using an online tool. So explain how this tool can be trusted to get things logged and fixed. Promote the services to others in the community, like the sheltered housing wardens \u2013 can they show residents how to use it or be encouraged to use it on their residents\u2019 behalf?\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso consider the complete journey. If your existing online repairs service results in a phone call to agree an appointment time, this only encourages the tenant to ring up next time. Confidence in an authority\u2019s own digital maturity is built by showing the resident a complete online journey that leaves them informed of what\u2019s happening next.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of putting in place an online repair service it\u2019s time to weigh up the pros and cons of having a login. The best way to do this is to get out and speak to the people who matter the most: those who\u2019ll be using it.\u00a0\nTweetLinkedInFacebook\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nFraser Trickett\nClient Partner at Made Tech\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about Housing\n\n\nHow we\u2019re shaping our Housing Repairs product to address communal repair needs\nSince releasing our Housing Repairs SaaS product in March, we\u2019ve been working to extend the product\u2019s functionality.
