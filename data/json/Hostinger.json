From board games to puppy yoga and wine tasting, these experiences struck the perfect balance between celebrating and getting to know our clients.\u00a0\nJoin us as we share these memorable experiences and our clients\u2019 success stories.\u00a0\nFrom Friends to Company Parties\nFirst, we had a board game party hosted by Offline Game Club. Besides having fun, playing board games also strengthens skills like reaction, strategic thinking, communication, and even bluffing.\nThe founders of Offline Game Club have been passionate about board games for over two decades. They\u2019ve explored numerous games, attended international exhibitions, and grown their personal game collections. What began as a hobby and casual game nights for friends evolved into an actual job.\u00a0\n\u201cWe now organize team-building events featuring various board games for both small gatherings and large festivals. Our unique collection of exclusive games ensures there\u2019s something for everyone to enjoy,\u201d shares Andrius Pilypaitis, one of the company\u2019s founders.\u00a0\n\n\nWebsite Is a Must for Scaling\u00a0\nStarting this business was challenging due to the various misconceptions surrounding it. This is where their website played a crucial role. Through images and videos, they could effectively convey the excitement and diversity of their games. Additionally, customer testimonials on their website have been instrumental in finding new clients.\n\u201cWe chose Hostinger for its reliability and good customer service. We got what we expected \u2013 a very easy-to-set-up and manage website. The era of needing a friend-of-a-friend to build your website is over. Nowadays, website creation and editing are so user-friendly that most people can do it themselves,\u201d he highlights.\u00a0\nIntroducing the New Way of Yoga\nOne of our clients, Woof Yoga, combines relaxation with playful puppies. It is an excellent team-building exercise, allowing colleagues to connect in a fun and adorable setting.\u00a0\nThe creators of Woof Yoga, David Erenburg, Dovydas Da\u0161\u010dioras, and Gabriel\u0117 Zdanavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, come from different fields \u2013 logistics, construction, and marketing. United by their love for animals and sports, they decided to introduce pet yoga to Lithuania.\n\u201cInitially, it wasn\u2019t about business. We started by making calls and collecting people through social networks. Seeing the joy and repeated attendance of participants, we decided to move further,\u201d David explains.\u00a0\n\n\nQuality Comes First\nThe Woof Yoga team prioritizes high-quality classes by limiting participant numbers and varying the puppy breeds. They\u2019ve found that their sessions appeal to a diverse range of people, offering various benefits from emotional to physical wellness. Starting with just five sessions per month, the business now hosts multiple sessions per day.\n\u201cAs soon as we came up with the idea, we knew we wanted a website here and now. It\u2019s been pivotal in simplifying session bookings and management, freeing up our time for other important aspects, like communicating with the kennels, advertising, and improving yoga. The website maintenance is convenient and easy, and the support team\u2019s work is exceptional!\u201d \u2013 shares David.\nPursuing the Dream\nJust before Christmas, our team was inspired by another client who drastically changed her career to pursue her dream. Ieva Elvyra Kazakevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 and her wine-tasting event business, Gliu Gliu, offered a delightful blend of education and enjoyment, perfect for spending quality time and learning.\nIeva\u2019s journey is diverse, from children\u2019s radio hosting to creating internationally renowned albums and magazines, writing for prime-time TV, and working in fintech. She says she finally found her passion \u2013 wine-tasting events, which are getting popular on various occasions, from birthdays to corporate celebrations.\u00a0\n\u201cI began studying to be a sommelier to learn something new and have fun after work. I always look to simplify things and convey them in a way that\u2019s relatable to my audience. That\u2019s what I felt was missing in the local wine scene. It felt like many people around me would be able to appreciate wine a lot more if it was presented to them in a simple way,\u201c she says.\u00a0\n\n\nAs Ieva Elvyra Kazakevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 highlights, her goal is to create a safe space for her audience, with no concept of stupid questions. During her events, she tries to teach people a quick checklist about wine \u2013 how do you taste it? What do you look for in it? What questions do you ask to find a wine for the occasion?\u00a0\nEmbracing a Website as a Key Business Tool\nIeva initially hesitated to create a website, thinking it was a big deal she still had to grow into. However, a friend\u2019s suggested viewing it as an online business card and recommended Hostinger \u2013 she ended up creating a website in a day. To her, it\u2019s a vital platform for promoting natural winemaking and attracting new clients.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe user experience on Hostinger Website Builder made me feel like a world-class web creator. It\u2019s all about arranging elements, playing with some colors, and voil\u00e0! Learning to promote my site and increase traffic has been fascinating. While word-of-mouth advertising is crucial in my field, people often research before reaching out. With the website, I show my personality and vibe fairly accurately for people to decide,\u201d she explains.\u00a0\nAll the clients we\u2019ve met agree that having a website is a pivotal part of growing a business. These websites serve as platforms for booking and raising your brand awareness to attract more clients. These stories show that a well-crafted website is necessary for connecting with audiences and achieving success.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author\nKotryna D\n\n\n\n\n            Part of Hostinger\u2019s Communications Team, Kotryna is responsible for building and maintaining relationships with media outlets and ensuring that the organization's achievements and initiatives receive public recognition.
