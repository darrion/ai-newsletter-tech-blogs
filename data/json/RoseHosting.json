Overview, Importance, Tips and Best Practices\n   \nJanuary 2, 2024January 1, 2024 by Jeff Wilson \n\n\n\n\n\nMany hosting providers claim to provide optimal uptime for their customers. What is uptime, though?\u00a0\nUptime is simply the length of time a server, website, etc. is on and operating properly. In simpler terms, if your server is frequently inaccessible and takes your website down, then it has a lot of downtime, or low uptime. Good uptime therefore means that your server simply does not lock up or go offline often, or at all, and your website is available to your visitors at all times.\nWebsite availability, website uptime or uptime are often times used interchangeably. A website with high uptime rate guarantees consistent delivery of intended services, while a website with low uptime rate introduces doubt to its users.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nToggleWhat is Uptime? A Helpful OverviewWhat Decides Uptime?Why is Uptime Important? How Uptime Impacts Your BusinessHow to Monitor your UptimeTips and Best PracticesConclusion\nWhat is Uptime? A Helpful Overview\nUptime is the term referring to the time which an IT system or a computer is functioning or working. It can also refer to a metric that shows the percentage of time that a computer network, device or hardware is fully functioning. Uptime is measured in percentiles \u2013 for example, the expression \u201cfive 9\u2019s\u201d means that the hardware, device or computer network is operational 99.999 percent of the time.\nDowntime, on the other hand, is the opposite of uptime. It refers to the period in which a system is not functioning or operational. These two terms are commonly used in a Service Level Agreement (SLA) or a contract, showing uptime/downtime ratios of how much time a service is operational or functioning.\nIT professionals identify uptime as the total consecutive amount of operational time. For example, a computer system that has been operational for 2 weeks has an uptime of 2 weeks. High availability of a system is what most customers look for, since it defines an operational performance that is beneficial to their needs. Having high availability guarantees operational standards that keeps their businesses available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nAside from operational performance, uptime is also a sign of network reliability. Network reliability represents the length of time a system is operational even if left unattended. It guarantees that a network will not disconnect at random or need frequent maintenance.\nWhat Decides Uptime?\nThree factors that are important in data center uptime are hardware reliability, availability and serviceability (or RAS). In case of server failure, failover and redundant servers serving as a backup helps maintain your website\u2019s uptime.\nAnother known uptime strategy is server clustering. Server clustering delivers high availability of workloads and IT services. A group of linked servers, called a server cluster, work together to improve a system\u2019s load balancing, service availability and performance. In case a server fails, other servers within the cluster can take over workloads and functions of the failed server.\n\nWhy is Uptime Important? How Uptime Impacts Your Business\nUptime measures the time a service or a computer is available, online and operational. Although, it might seem like a simple technical term that can be ignored, uptime of your website plays a vital role in the welfare of your business.\nStrengthen the Customer\u2019s Trust and Loyalty\nAn optimal uptime and network reliability strengthens the customer\u2019s trust and loyalty. In contrast, having a website that is unreachable deteriorates your brand\u2019s image rapidly. Even if your website is not servicing a technical industry, outages and downtime can compromise and damage your business.\nInternet connectivity and reachability nowadays as a commodity, like water and electricity. It is very easy to quantify the impact of downtime to your business and brand image if your business is not 100% reachable or online.\nSave your Business Time and Money\nDowntime costs time, which in turn costs you revenue. For instance, having downtime can impact your customers trying to get a hold of your services or products. They lost time trying to get information from your site or purchasing something. You on the other hand, lose time by communicating with your provider to try and resolve the issue. With downtime, you inevitably lose new orders and will accumulate bad impressions from your visitors.\nLost time is lost productivity, and lost productivity is a loss of money. The impact of not having a reachable website, even for an hour, has a domino effect on your business. A fully operational website saves you from all of this hassle and loss.\nSecure your Revenue Stream\nYour revenue is secured with a hosting provider that is reliable and guarantees an optimal uptime. This is very important!\nA website that is not reachable renders your brand, services or products essentially gone. Your business becomes unavailable to the world for as long as the outage is not resolved. Potential customers can\u2019t read information from your website, purchase products or services, and you have no way to promote your goods or services. You are losing money if your website is not operational.\nA downtime\u2019s impact may differ from business to business. An e-commerce business who relies on 100% uptime suffers more than a small business (such as a physical brick-and-mortar store) that can generally operate even if their website suffers a downtime of an hour or more.\nTo calculate your potential lost revenue, you just need to multiply the number of downtime hours with the hourly revenue you make. Then you can check the percentage by comparing your revenue streams that may be dependent on your website\u2019s uptime. For example, you figure out that your website revenue is 30% of your entire business revenue and you make $1000/h, an hour of downtime would cost you $300.\nImproved SEO Ranking\nAn optimal uptime also has a positive impact in your website\u2019s SEO. Google periodically checks your website\u2019s availability \u2013 it will penalize your website\u2019s rankings if they notice that your website is often offline. Bear in mind, this will only impact you if there is frequent downtime. A downtime incident that is occasional will probably be fine, but it\u2019s still best if you can go for a provider that offers excellent uptime.\nTechnical SEO consists of many factors, but a high uptime percentage will at least contribute to an improved SEO score for your website.\n\nHow to Monitor your Uptime\nWhat is Uptime Monitoring?\nUptime monitoring is an automated method of checking whether an application or a website is available. When the site or server becomes inaccessible, the system alerts the designated person responsible for the uptime.\nHow is Uptime Monitored?\nMonitoring process is done by sending automated HTTP requests to a specific URL at a preset frequency and then checking for the response. There are also other HTTP requests that can be used, like for monitoring other functionality and APIs. The pre-determined frequency of the checks is dependent on the user\u2019s specific needs. Normally, it can range from 30 seconds for business websites, to 10 minutes or more for hobby projects and websites.\nMost often, the 200 OK HTTP response code is the desired response code from a monitored URL, however there are other codes that might be acceptable depending on the scenario.\nUptime monitoring can also monitor desired keyword in a response. This is done to assure correct display of some important parts of the website or in health checks. Keywords like subscribe or signup, are often monitored to assure the most vital user actions are performing as they should.\nMonitoring continues when the correct keyword or code is received from a URL. But when a different code is received, monitor starts a downtime incident and will send alerts depending to the on-call calendar.\nWhat is a Downtime Incident?\nDowntime, or a downtime incident is a period of time during which a given server or service is unavailable. Any users trying to use the service or server during downtime will see the website\u2019s error page or an error page generated by their browser.\nA downtime can also refer to a situation where the request sent by the monitor doesn\u2019t receive a response in a provided time frame. This is called a timeout. The timeout can be anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the priority of the monitor and the expected response time from the service. Setting the monitor sensitivity correctly is important in avoiding false-positive alerts.\nHow to Ensure Optimal Uptime\nTo ensure optimal equipment uptime, start by purchasing or subscribing to a high-quality hosting provider. The higher the uptime percentage guaranteed by them, the better. Our Linux VPS hosting for example comes with a 100% uptime guarantee, meaning you will experience exactly zero downtime at any point in a typical month.\n\n\nNeed a fast and easy fix?\n\n\u2714 Unlimited Managed Support\n\u2714 Supports Your Software\n\u2714 2 CPU Cores\n\u2714 2 GB RAM\n\u2714 50 GB PCIe4 NVMe Disk\n\u2714 1854 GeekBench Score\n\u2714 Unmetered Data Transfer\n\n\n\nNVME 2 VPS\nNow just\u00a0$43\n.99/mo \n\nGET YOUR VPS\n\n\nAside from choosing superior and reliable hosting and hardware, we recommend selecting reliable software and a reliable operating system to run your website. Do not use beta software, and do not choose a hobbyist operating system. Go for something well-maintained such as Debian, which is very stable.\nPerform preventative maintenance instead of reactive maintenance. This involves preparing for scenarios before they happen, instead of fixing errors only once they occur. This helps prevent surprises down the road. Keep in mind that this should be done within reason as not all assets require preventive maintenance. Critical tasks should be prioritized for preventive maintenance like keeping optimal uptime. Whereas tasks that do not affect the uptime of the site should only be done as needed.\nPreventive maintenance for systems or hardware increases your team\u2019s efficiency and ensures your website continues to be available.\n\nTips and Best Practices\nKeeping systems, servers, and hardware running at optimal performance and reliability is the goal of any server provider, website owner, and data center.\nHere\u2019s 5 steps to maximizing your system\u2019s uptime.\n\nPlan Ahead.\u00a0We have briefly discussed about preventive maintenance and its importance. Enforcement of life-cycle management, system configurations, double-checking of work and maintenance schedules will go a long way in keeping fully functioning systems or servers. Doing upgrades and server acquisitions should be coordinated and done when fewest users would be affected.\nMonitoring and management tools. These tools can help determine how often you have uptime issues. Monitoring and management tools can also help in measuring the impact of a downtime on critical business services.\nDon\u2019t let attackers interfere. Independent audits, firewalls, and anti-malware products are some of the security tools that have positive impact on maintaining optimal server uptime.\nQuality over price. Quality hardware is the key to fully functioning servers. Cheap hardware and hosting can never compete with quality hardware.\nChoose wisely. There are offers that are enticing, but don\u2019t waste time, money, and energy on offers that are too good to be true. Research and verify before making decisions for your hosting and software, especially if your business is at stake.\n\nConclusion\nFollowing the steps above will help you achieve optimal uptime, and even a 100% uptime rate for your website. Preventive maintenance rather than reactive maintenance, setting up server monitoring and investing in high quality hosting are all vital in ensuring your business\u2019 accessibility.\nWith the help of a reliable hosting provider and a little bit of effort, you can achieve optimal uptime, or even a 100% uptime rate!\n \n\nTags Fully Managed Hosting, uptime \nHow to Install Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL on AlmaLinux 9\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment CommentName\nEmail\n Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n\n\u00a0Yes, add me to your new blog post notifications list\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategoriesCategories\nSelect Category\nAffiliate\u00a0\u00a0(1)\nBlogging\u00a0\u00a0(3)\nCaching\u00a0\u00a0(23)\nCentOS\u00a0\u00a0(305)\nCloud\u00a0\u00a0(2)\nCMS, CRM, ERP\u00a0\u00a0(261)\nControl Panels\u00a0\u00a0(49)\nDatabases\u00a0\u00a0(120)\nDebian\u00a0\u00a0(204)\nE-Commerce\u00a0\u00a0(71)\nEmail Servers\u00a0\u00a0(39)\nForum\u00a0\u00a0(1)\nGuides\u00a0\u00a0(111)\nLinux\u00a0\u00a0(21)\nLoad Balancing\u00a0\u00a0(5)\nManaged Hosting\u00a0\u00a0(8)\nNetworking and Domains\u00a0\u00a0(44)\nNews\u00a0\u00a0(10)\nOpen-source\u00a0\u00a0(30)\nOptimization\u00a0\u00a0(22)\nOther\u00a0\u00a0(6)\nRoseHosting Platform\u00a0\u00a0(49)\nScripts\u00a0\u00a0(11)\nSecurity\u00a0\u00a0(110)\nSEO\u00a0\u00a0(9)\nSocial Networks\u00a0\u00a0(1)\nTips and Tricks\u00a0\u00a0(90)\nTutorials\u00a0\u00a0(1,011)\nUbuntu\u00a0\u00a0(487)\nWeb Development\u00a0\u00a0(3)\nWeb Frameworks\u00a0\u00a0(127)\nWeb Servers\u00a0\u00a0(159)\n\n\nFastest Managed VPS $39\nManaged Dedicated Servers\nUpto $500 Affiliate Program\n\nLifetime Discount VPS\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nOur Company\nOur Policies\nContact Us\nWhy RoseHosting\nCompare Us\nCustomer Reviews\nAwards & Recognition\n\nContent Hub\n\nFastest Web Hosting\nFully-Managed Hosting\nBusiness Website Guide\nNVMe vs. SSD\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n24/7 Managed Support\nManaged Migration\nSystems Status\n\nOther Services\n\nDomain Registration\nDomain Transfer\nSSL Certificates\n\n\n\nManaged Hosting\n\nLinux VPS Hosting\nDedicated Servers\nWordPress Hosting\nCustom VPS\nHosting Solutions\nAffiliate Program\n\n\n\nLinux VPS Hosting\n\nAlmaLinux Hosting\nUbuntu Hosting\nDebian Hosting\nDocker Hosting\nWHM Hosting\ncPanel Hosting\nDirectAdmin Hosting\n\n\n\nApps Hosting\n\nMagento Hosting\nOdoo Hosting\nJoomla Hosting\nDrupal Hosting\nLaravel Hosting\nNextcloud Hosting\nPrestaShop Hosting\nGhost Hosting\nMediaWiki Hosting\nJava Hosting\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n(888) ROSE-HOST\n(888) 767-3467\n(314) 275-0414\nEmail us\n\nConnect\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Service and other policies\nResidents of California: Do not sell my personal information\n\u00a9 2001-2023 Rose Web Services LLC.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
